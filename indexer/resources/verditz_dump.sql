Media Matters has the run down:\n- Vice President Dick Cheney asserted that the article ?made it more difficult for us to prevent attacks in the future? and ?will enable the terrorists to look for ways to defeat our efforts.?\n- President Bush commented, ?If you want to figure out what the terrorists are doing, you try to follow their money. And that?s exactly what we?re doing. And the fact that a newspaper disclosed it makes it harder to win this war on terror.?\n- White House press secretary Tony Snow said the newspaper ?ought to think long and hard about whether a public?s right to know in some cases might override somebody?s right to live? and suggested that the article ?could place in jeopardy the safety of fellow Americans.?\n- Michelle Malkin, syndicated columnist: ?The New York Times (proudly publishing all the secrets unfit to spill since 9/11) and their reckless anonymous sources (come out, come out, you cowards) tipped off terrorists to America?s efforts to track their financial activities.? [?The terrorist-tipping Times,? 6/28/06]\n- Brit Hume, Fox News Washington managing editor: ?[N]ow they [the terrorists] know it. That?s the problem. Now they know it. ? The objective is to find out what channels they are using, who?s got the money and where it?s coming from. ? You don?t want to drive this stuff further underground because it undermines your ability to track it and to stop it.? [Fox Broadcasting Co.?s Fox News Sunday, 6/25/06]\nBut as Media Matters noted at the time, these charges were unfounded. ?The Times report was hardly the first indication of U.S. efforts to monitor terrorists? financial transactions: President Bush himself repeatedly touted the government?s capability to track and shut down terrorists? international financial networks.?\nYet conservatives still exploited the story for political purposes. Since the ?selective moral outrage crowd? denounced the allegedly ?liberal New York Times? for undermining American interests and aiding the terrorists, shouldn?t one expect even harsher condemnation for the Bush administration?\nThis entry was is filed under Corruption.

7	Majority of GOP candidates: The President possessed the the authority to attack Iran, if it posed an imminent threat, without Congressional approval.  Ron Paul: "Why don't we just open up the Constitution and read it!  This is just war propaganda."	GOP "War Propaganda" on Iran\nHome Blog: Campaign 08 GOP "War Propaganda" on Iran\nGOP "WAR PROPAGANDA" ON IRAN... The GOP presidential debate in Detroit today was ostensibly about the economy (more on that later). Soon enough, however, the topic turned to foreign policy, most notably Iran.\nModerator Chris Matthews asked the contenders if they believed a future president possessed the the authority to attack Iran without Congressional approval.\nApparently unaware that the Constitution gives only Congress the power to declare war, the GOP candidates answered, by and large, yes. They could attack Iran, if it posed an imminent threat, without consulting the Congress.\nMitt Romney said he'd have to check with his lawyers. But he vowed to "take action necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons." By my recollection, all the rest of the candidates said pretty much the same thing.\nOnly Ron Paul, as has so often been the case in the debates, forcefully dissented. "Why don't we just open up the Constitution and read it!" said an exasperated Paul. "The idea that Iran is on the verge of an imminent attack is just preposterous!"\nHe summed up the foreign policy views of his competitors thusly: "This is just war propaganda!"\nPosted by Ari Berman at 10/09/2007 @ 6:01pm | Email This Post\nCOMMENTS\nPosting a comment requires registration.

The point is that the constitution only gives the right to declare war to the Congress. Our founding fathers were smart enough to know that starting a war was of a large enough consequence that leaving it up to the preident's office alone was a bad idea. Unfortunately those in this administration as well as many outside of it, like you, don't care what the constituion says.

8	Wal-Mart closes Quebec store and fires everyone because workers had unionized	Wal-Mart fired Jonquiere workers illegally, board rules\nWal-Mart fired Jonquiere workers illegally, board rules\nCompensation ordered for employees who filed\nformal complaints after store closure last spring\nJonquiere, Quebec (22 Dec. 2005) - Wal-Mart has been found guilty by the Quebec labour board of closing its Jonquiere store last spring to avoid dealing with unionized workers ? not because it was losing money as it claimed at the time.\nAfter hearing four of 79 illegal dismissal complaints filed by workers at the store, the board concluded that the Arkansas-based retail giant had acted in violation of Quebec law and that it fired the workers unfairly.\nThe employees were dismissed because they were engaging in legal union activities, the board ruled.\nOne fact entered in evidence was that the company has yet to rescind a 20-year lease on its premises in Jonquiere. No attempt has been made to sublet the space, indicating that the company is keeping its options for the future open.\nThe board has ruled that Wal-Mart must compensate workers for its actions. Appropriate remedies will be decided later.\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW Canada) said the ruling backs up what the union has claimed from the outset and what polls show that citizens across Quebec generally believe.\nMomentum picking up\nThe National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) has signed a formal protocol with UFCW Canada, supporting its efforts to organize Wal-Mart workers across Canada.\n"Wal-Mart clearly closed this store because the workers succeeded in unionizing," says Yvon Bellemare, president of the UFCW Canada's Quebec council.\n"The Labour Relations Board's decision once again exposes the multinational's anti-union attitude. The momentum is picking up. Wal-Mart employees now realize that if they want a union in their store, Wal-Mart may attempt to but can't stop them."\nQuebec Federation of Labour President Henri Mass� also hailed the decision and called on Wal-Mart to abide by the ruling and to dispense with its the now-familiar "legal guerrilla tactics" it has been using to prolong its anti-union war in the province.\nThe Jonquiere outlet was the first full Wal-Mart store in North America to be unionized. Approximately 190 employees lost their jobs when the store was closed. At the time the company was on the brink of having a first contract imposed by the board after its refusal to negotiate in good faith with the union. A total of 79 workers subsequently filed formal complaints.

Photograph: Sebastian Scheiner/AP\nThe Israeli army has ordered the seizure of Palestinian land surrounding four West Bank villages apparently in order to hugely expand settlements around Jerusalem, it emerged yesterday.\nThe confiscation happened as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met to prepare the ground for a meeting hosted by President George Bush in the United States aimed at reviving a diplomatic solution to the conflict.\nHowever, critics said the confiscation of land suggested that Israel was imposing its own solution on the Palestinians through building roads, barriers and settlements that would render a Palestinian state unviable.\nThe land seized forms a corridor from East Jerusalem to Jericho and is intended to be used for a road that would be for Palestinians only. Analysts said the road would run on one side of the Israeli security barrier, while the existing Jerusalem-Jericho road would be reserved for Israelis.\nA spokeswoman for the Israeli army said it was necessary to build a road to link Bethlehem and the Judea region with Jericho and the Jordan valley area in order to "improve the quality of life" for Palestinians.\nShe said the road would be nearly 10 miles long and would be built on 145 hectares (357 acres) of state land and 23 hectares of private land that had been confiscated. She added that the army had designed the route to minimise losses to private landowners.\nAdam Keller of the Israeli peace group, Gush Shalom, said the confiscation of land belonging to the villages of Abu Dis, Arab al-Sawahra, Nebi Musa and Talhin Alhamar would "rob many villagers of their sole livelihood" but would also "facilitate the big annexation plan known as E-1, which is aimed at linking the settlement of Ma'aleh Adummim with Jerusalem and cutting the West Bank in two."\nHe said the confiscations were aimed at constructing a "Palestinian bypass road" that would "push the Palestinian traffic between Bethlehem and Ramallah deep into the desert and effectively bar them from the central part of the West Bank".\nThe E-1 area has been marked out on Israeli government maps for years but the state has refrained from large scale development of the area. The only building to be completed is the proposed headquarters of the Israeli police in the West Bank.\nThe plan for the area envisages 3,500 housing units and dozens of businesses which have yet to be started, although infrastructure such as roads and drainage is being constructed.\nJeff Halper, an Israeli geographer who specialises in Israel's development of the West Bank, said it appeared that there was a rush to carry out as much work as possible before the US-sponsored meeting between Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, in Annapolis, Maryland, in November.\n"They want to push everything as far as possible before the November meeting because that will be seen as the starting point for everything," he said. "Anything done before that meeting will be set in stone. In general this has to be seen as part of a timeline in which Israel wants to get all its development of the West Bank finished before Bush leaves office."\nThe land confiscation orders emerged as Palestinian officials claimed that a revised route of the West Bank barrier would eat into substantially more Palestinian land than the previous route.\nThe negotiation affairs department of the Palestine Liberation Organisation said information released by the Israeli ministry of defence showed that the new route would annex 12% of the West Bank, compared with 9% previously.\nThe biggest change in the route of the barrier is in the south-east of the West Bank, adjacent to the coastline of the Dead Sea. The area is mostly uninhabited but could be useful for industry or tourism in the future.\nThe new route also adds in two settlements, Nili and Na'aleh, which would result in five villages close to Ramallah being almost totally surrounded by the barrier, the PLO statement said.\nIsrael says that the security barrier, which is in parts a high concrete wall and in other parts a steel fence with wide ditches, is vital for ensuring security in Israel.\nHowever, the PLO statement said that the main aim of the barrier was "to consolidate Israeli control over the most critical parts of the occupied West Bank, including all of Palestinian East Jerusalem and vital land and water resources, all of which severely undercuts prospects for establishing a viable, independent Palestinian state."\nSpecial report\nIsrael and the Middle East\nWorld news guide\nIsrael and the Palestinian territories\nMiddle East\nGlossary\nCommonly used terms in the Middle East conflict\nInteractive guide\nHow the Israelis and Palestinians came to war\nIsrael enters Gaza\nGovernment sites\nIsraeli Knesset (parliament)\nIsraeli ministry of foreign affairs\nIsraeli government site\nOffice of the Israeli prime minister\nPalestinian Ministry of Information\nMedia\nHa'aretz (Israel)\nIsrael Insider (Israel)\nJerusalem Post (Israel)\nMaariv (Israel)\nArabic Media Internet Network (Palestinian)\nPalestine Chronicle (Palestinian)\nElectronic Intifada (Palestinian)\nBitter Lemons (Israeli-Palestinian)\nPrintable version | Send it to a friend | Save story\nPrivacy policy | Terms & conditions | Advertising guide | A-Z index | About this site\nJoin our dating site today\nGuardian Unlimited � Guardian News and Media Limited 2007	2007-10-10 00:00:00	http://politics.reddit.com/goto?rss=true&id=2ykyc	1

14	Starting Salaries for Computer Science Grads Hit Highest Amount This Decade	Starting salaries surge for computer science grads\nHome\nBusiness\nApple\nGaming\nHardware\nGear & Gadgets\nLaw & Disorder\n');\nHome\nNews\nArticles\nGuides\nJournals\nForum\nShop.ars\nEmporium\nRSS\nFrom the Newsdesk\nStarting salaries surge for computer science grads\nBy Nate Anderson | Published: October 09, 2007 - 11:10PM CT\nI was once a computer science major. It lasted a week and did not involve taking any actual computer science courses. Then I came to my senses and studied literature and philosophy instead. That decision has affected my life in two significant ways: 1) I still can't properly allocate memory in C, and 2) I face the prospect of a lifetime filled with low-paying jobs.\nFrom a financial perspective, this didn't look like such a boneheaded decision a few years later when the dot-com crash and subsequent mass migration of programming jobs to south Asia caused comp-sci students to bolt from their programs like horses from a barn fire. The Chronicle of Higher Education noted this development back in 2005, saying, "New data show students' interest in the discipline is in a free fall. The number of newly declared computer-science majors declined 32 percent from the fall of 2000 to the fall of 2004."\nStudents worried that good jobs were being outsourced or would otherwise be unavailable, and enrollment in computer science programs dropped. But, given the massive drop-off in the number of comp-sci students and the robust growth of IT in the US, the inevitable has now happened: computer science degrees are now worth some serious cash.\nA recent study of post-college careers from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (also noted by the Chronicle) found that computer-science grads saw their average starting salary offers grow by 4.5 percent last year alone. The new average salary for a job right out of college is now $53,051. That's the highest amount this decade.\nEvery discipline is seeing raises, though humanities grads tend to receive offers in the $30,000s. Even the humble English major, the one who has to put up with the endless array of cracks about flipping burgers to pay the rent, saw a 1.7 percent increase last year to $31,924. Apparently, fast food pays more than it used to.\nAs salaries rise, especially in the better-paying disciplines, we may see the interest in comp-sci degrees surge again, possibly depressing wages and driving majors back out of the programs. For now, though, computer science looks like a well-paid place to be. As for English majors, well, if they value the cash, they can always write more about technology than about Cervantes.\nFiled under: college, salary, computer science\nInternet2 hits 100Gbps, could scale 10x beyond that :Prev Post\nLatest News Posts\nLatest Journal Posts\nStarting salaries surge for computer science grads\nInternet2 hits 100Gbps, could scale 10x beyond that\nMeet the Google Broadcasting Company: AdSense video units are game-changing\nLead-free regulations giving way to gadget-killing "tin whiskers"\nAT&T relents on controversial Terms of Service, announces changes\nRecord label defections by major acts a troubling sign for recording industry\nAT&T surprises with beachfront 700MHz spectrum purchase\nBitTorrent uses "evil" P2P goodness to speed video streaming\niPods gaining school district approval as language education tools\nNintendo prices, dates Wii Fit in Japan: December 1 for $75\nWii Ware games announced: new Final Fantasy, Pokemon games incoming\nSonic to be a playable character in Super Smash Bros.

I think it doesn't matter, and that radiohead acknowledges that there isn't money in selling recordings. Instead they are using it as a promotional tool to sell other things. (We will have to wait and see what the other things are.)\npermalink parent\nleahzero 2 points 35 minutes ago\nRadiohead is not exactly standing at the side of the road with an honesty box. Like Trent Reznor and Prince, they became highly successful under the old music industry business model, and now have the luxury to take risks like this.\nI like Radiohead and am not going to pay for this either.\nHowever, if it's good, I will share it with friends and colleagues. My payment to the band is in the form of word-of-mouth promotion. People I share the music with will probably be quite intrigued with the idea of paying what you want, and some may donate cash, buy merch, go to shows, etc. To me, that's fair compensation for good music.\npermalink parent\njunaman 2 points 3 hours ago\nThen people will just continue torrenting...

If you look at this, the artist normally only gets �1.36 per album sold.\nI'm not a massive fan of Radiohead, never really liked their music, but I gave them �3.50 because it's more than they would've got if I bought the CD, and I support this idea completely.\nThis is the first album I've purchased in about 5 years.\nIf everyone on Reddit buys it for �1.50 ($3), even if they hate the music, the support for the idea will make people turn their heads.\npermalink parent\nomarkj -1 points 3 hours ago\nIs making the package sending them to customers and so on free? Yes, each artist might only get paid 1.36 pounds/album when sold through a label, but when you pay them 1.50 pounds for the album you've got to remember that they're paying for all the materials, shipping etc., and I highly doubt it's enough.\npermalink parent\nunderthelinux 2 points 1 hour ago\n... it is.\nWhen you buy in the huge amounts of bulk that these guys do, its very very very cheap for things like shipping & materials.

Im an big fan of Radiohead, and your right they might have too much money already, but if you want any musicians to do this in the future, its important to give enough to make it worth while for others considering it.\nA buck or two is more than they'd get for a CD sale. Im sure you can afford it.\nDisney and the other RIAA arseholes are taking most of the moeny from CD sales, dont give them money instead buy buying music on Steve Jobs's label (the largest Disney Corporation shareholder and Board Member) by not supporting such distribution schemes.\nExecutives like Steve Jobs are RIAA anti-fair use advocates, DRM shills and fair-use thieves. Dont help them buy ruining Radio Heads experiment.\nThis is a great primer on the economics of the way Steve Jobs (and his RIAA executive friends) treat musicians:\nhttp://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/index.html\npermalink parent\noktay 5 points 5 hours ago\nI am not saying Courtney Love plagiarized Steve Albini's well known article, but here's the link to that:\nhttp://www.arancidamoeba.com/mrr/problemwithmusic.html\nCheers.\npermalink parent\neightnine 2 points 4 hours ago\nYou might not say that, but it's kinda clear she did.\npermalink parent\nashmodai 1 point 4 hours ago\nOh right, it's all Stevie J's fault. Let me paint you a picture here:\nImagine Apple hadn't released the iPod, and subsequently, the iTMS. All MP3 players today would run WMA, all music stores would be WMA. You can kiss Mac and Linux compatibility goodbye. And if you think Microsoft would have your best interests at heart, well, friend, I have a lovely bridge I'd like to sell you.\nThe iTMS showed the music business that there was money to be made through the internet, provided it is done well. Look at all the other music stores online, none have them have even a modicum of success. If there hadn't been an iTMS, piracy would be the only viable online solution, and as a result, the music industry would come down even harder on file-sharers.\nBootnote: I have never downloaded anything from iTMS, because of the DRM and the too low bitrates.\npermalink parent\nrobosatan 31 points 8 hours ago\nlol, you can download it from their official site for free if you choose to. That's the point of this topic, they're letting you chose the price you pay.\nAlso, Radiohead while technically pop music and mainstream are actually artists! They've released numerous albums all with a distinctly different sound. None of the usual "oh, crap coke prices are going up lets release another album" philosophy most bands follow.\npermalink parent\nNewSc2 7 points 6 hours ago\nI thought every transaction had a transaction fee?\nRegardless, I'm downloading it for $0, because I always listen to what I buy first.

Who knows, maybe this sort of thing could catch on enough for the record labels to finally realize that their system is broken and ineffective.\npermalink\njudgej2 8 points 4 hours ago\nSo, has anyone compared individual downloads yet?

I looked at her and smiled. She smiled back, and then, with nothing else to do, I returned to my writing while she was standing right next to me, staring at me.\n?Excuse me.?\n?Yes, little girl??\n?Are you a Christian??\nOh Jesus, I thought. I was never that great with little kids and now I really had to come up with something good, something tactful, something to keep myself calm while, at the same time, not making her run off screaming devil and crying hysterically.\n?Why?? That was the best I could do? Okay. Okay, I asked why, that?s okay.\n?Because, if, if you?re not, you?ll go to hell. I don?t want you to go to hell.?\n?I don?t believe in hell.?\nHer mouth dropped open and I looked around to see who my audience was. I had two gray-haired women staring at me, one through her spectacles, the other one from over her spectacles? rims.\n?But there is a hell.?\n?I don?t think so.?\n?Why not, it?s in the bible.?\nHere it goes. Now I have to look like a jerk and be a pain in the ass with a little girl in pigtails. ?I don?t read the bible.?\n?You should. You?ll go to hell if you don?t.?\n?You forget, I don?t believe in hell.?\n?Just because you don?t believe in it doesn?t mean it doesn?t exist.?\n?Do you believe in Lala land?? I asked her.\n?What?s Lala Land??\n?A lot of people already live there and they don?t believe it.?\n?Is it in the bible??\n?I don?t know, I don?t read the bible.?\n?Do you go to church??\n?Not your church.?\n?But you go to a church??\n?Listen little girl?you?re really cute and all, but I don?t believe in Jesus.?\nI was getting tired of her mouth dropping open. I was working on a great idea for a story. All I had so far was: ?Though he was blindfolded and sitting in the middle of a park, thousands of miles (he thought) away from everyone, he could smell her fragrance in the air.?\n?Jesus loves you. How could you not believe in him.? I looked around for help. I saw a Hassid in the corner and tried to pawn her off on him, ?look, over there. He doesn?t look like he loves Jesus, either. Why are you picking on me??\n?I?m saving you.?\n?I don?t have time to be saved today. Maybe next Friday.?\nShe ignored me. ?Jesus loves you.? She stared at me a second before she said, ?I just want to give you this.? She handed me a pamphlet of with a giant church on it. It kind of looked like Epcot with a giant cross on top.\n?That?s alright. I?ve got one already.?\n?No you didn?t. I never gave you one.?\n?Can we just say you did so that we can save a tree? I?d hate to waste a tree on Jesus.?\n?Jesus made the trees.?\n?What??\n?Jesus made the trees.?\nI took out the Environment Colorado flyer someone had handed me earlier and gave it to her, ?then save them, by God, they?re precious.? I handed it to her ? there was a big, glossy tree on the front.\n?Just?take it.? She put the pamphlet on my table and pushed my head back, saying ?Go with Jesus,? before walking off with the Environment Colorado flyer.\nOn my way out, I dropped the pamphlet in the recycling bin and saved a tree in the name of Jesus.\nShare This\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

Just tell her that it is all a lie. That her parents are lieing to her, that the church is lieing to her, all her friends are likewise being lied to.

Unfortunately his name is �John Doe.� And the listed phone number is right out of the movies: 415.555-5555.\nIts known in the trade as "sloppy tradecraft."\n"Its My Party and I'll Bust Who I Want To"\nThe biggest clue to date to the true identity of the individuals or organization operating behind the dummy front of "Donna Blue Aircraft" may lie in its initials, "DBA," for "doing business as."\nIt is the kind of cute nomenclature for which "the boys" are known to be fond.\nFor the Bush Administration, which recently launched a PR offensive announcing major gains in the multibillion-dollar anti-drug effort in preparation for asking Congress for a $1 billion Plan Colombia-type aid package to help Mexico fight drug traffickers, the controversy could not have come at a worse time.\nThe billion dollars in proposed U.S. aid, Mexican newspapers pointed out, will only be used to target drug traffickers with no obvious ties to American intelligence.\nLeading to this extraordinary skepticism is the fact that recent investigations into downed drug planes have suffered, on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border, from a certain murkiness.\nNew Scientific Discovery Links Drug Planes to Quarks\nMexican authorities and the American DEA have apparently concluded that Mankind�s knowledge of the ownership of large commercial and business jets busted carrying multi-ton loads of narcotics is governed, like the understanding of the movement of subatomic quarks, by Heisenberg�s Uncertainty Principle.\nThe more influential the listed owner of the plane is, the more uncertain the identification becomes. The whole business, suggested a story which ran on the Associated Press, quickly moves beyond the realm of human ken�\n�How the U.S.-registered Gulfstream ended up in the hands of suspected drug traffickers remains a mystery,� reported the Associated Press.\nHow indeed? Let�s take a look.\nWhen the company�s principals, Joao Luiz Malago and Eduardo Dias Guimaraes, both Brazilian, forcefully denied that they still owned the plane, claiming it had been sold several weeks earlier to two American pilots in Florida, officials at the DEA (which sent a six-man team to the Yucatan crash site) the FBI, and the FAA were all conspicuous by their silence.\nSince then, there has been a growing perception expressed in the Mexican press that the owners of both of the American-registered drug plane�s seem to enjoy an apparent immunity from prosecution.\nSet a Straw Man Up, Set a Straw Man Down\n�The proprietary company of the unit, Donna Blue Inc. Aircraft (DBA), is another mystery and probably it is a ghost company,� reported Mexico City�s La Reforma.\nIndications point to the conclusion that their skepticism is justified.\nIncreasing suspicion even more was the suggestion, in a report of a committee of the European Parliament, that in addition to having been used in drug trafficking the Gulfstream II had flown CIA rendition flights to Guantanamo.\nUnnamed authorities quoted in Associated Press accounts dismissed this report, saying there was no evidence the plane flew renditions, but failed to address the fact that Guantanamo is highly restricted airspace, and any plane landing there can be presumed to be working for the U.S. Government.\nWhat has raised the crash-landing of the Gulfstream II drug plane with U.S. Government connections to the level of real outrage is its extraordinary similarity to the DC9 airliner caught a year and a half ago, after which the planes� registered owner suffered no ill consequences from having his airplane caught with 5.5 tons of cocaine onboard.\nThere are �wonderful similarities,� Mexican newspaper Por Esto reported drolly, �between the Gulfstream which crash-landed in the tiny hamlet of Tixkokob and the DC9 busted in Ciudad del Carmen which help explain why, despite the fact that almost 18 months has passed, the American owner of the DC9 has not been charged with any crime.�\nGhost Fleets of Ghost Planes owned by Ghost Companies\nThe reference is to information contained in a series of articles in the MadCowMorningNews detailing connections between the DC9 and the national Republican Party, like its unpaid use flying current Florida Republican Senator Mel Martinez around the state during his last week blitz before his election to the Senate in 2004.\nThe DC9�s owner was identified in FAA documents as Royal Sons� Inc., owned by Frederic Geffon of St. Petersburg.\nYet despite the fact that Geffon back-dated sales documents and then had them faxed to the FAA several days after his DC9 was already in the news for the big bust, no action has been taken against Geffon, or any other owners of the plane.\nGeffon claimed he had sold the DC9, several weeks before it was caught, and identified the buyer as an �airplane broker� in California who investigation revealed has no history of selling airplanes.\nThe circumstances of the subsequent �investigations� share many similarities. The governments involved�Mexico, the United States, Venezuela, and Colombia�all appear unable to agree on who owned the planes when they were busted.\nIn both cases Mexican authorities were quick to arrest individuals who authorities labeled crew members on the drug flights.\nThe Third Rail, The Big Taboo, & The Big Fix\nBut the plane�s ownership has been made to appear �murky,� although the owners of the planes at the time they were caught are clearly named in FAA documents. And both plane�s American owners appear to be escaping Scot-free.\nCould the confusion be deliberate?\nAn aviation executive in Venice thought so. "When it comes to registering airplanes, it�s the Wild West out there," he explained. �An airplane is a mobile, big ticket item. Yet there are no airport police doing ramp checks, or checking N numbers at airports.�\n�The FAA system for registering airplanes is little-changed from when it was started back in the good ol boy days of the 1930�s. Each plane has a paper folder, for example, stuffed with all correspondence regarding airworthiness and ownership relating to that plane.�\n�Its an antiquated system which some feel is kept deliberately in place to encourage a certain ambiguity when a plane is interdicted. When a change of registration is mailed in, the FAA places a plane�s folder in what they call �suspense.�\n�That�s a tremendous inducement to anyone with a chance of having a plane nabbed to keep floating sales in progress. The CIA, for example, is very adept at keeping files on its planes �in suspense.�\nAn airplane associated in some way with the U.S. Government, said an aviation source with a smirk, would have definite advantages for a drug smuggler.\nFool me once, shame on you.

Then another weird thought occurred to me...\nOur observed universe is self-contained within the event horizon of a giant black hole.\nWe're closer to the singularity, and accelerating towards it faster than objects closer to the edge of the event horizon. Time will move slower for us, and far away objects will appear to speed up. An outside observer (if such a thing could possibly exist) would perceive our universe as shrinking, but in our current frame of reference, we still think of it as expanding.\nOne other observation that lends to this possibility is the fact that we have not seen evidence of other "Big Bangs" or other "Universes". If the Big Bang happened once, shouldn't it be a repeatable occurrence in the limitless void of space?\nOkay, that's my rant.

Not according to current brane and bulk theories. In them, time and space existed forever, and still do. The big bang is just a massive release of energy, that reorders the energy and matter within our brane in a way that appears everything is moving away from that 4d point.\nOne suggestion was that two branes within the bulk colided, and all that energy that has to go somewhere goes into a big bang in a 4d brane (the bulk is either 10 or lately 11 dinentions while we are just in 4)\nIf those theories are correct, both time and space existed before the big bang, and also at some point in the future our brane will collide with another again and cause another big bang. This happens through out all the branes at different times and repeats forever.\nNote that I word my post as if "this is", when it should be pointed out that my wording is this way "if these theories are right", so please take it as such.\n[ Reply to This | Parent ]\nRe:Time speeding up (Score:5, Funny)\nby ObsessiveMathsFreak (773371)  on Tuesday October 09, @02:48PM (#20915431)\n(http://obsessivemathsfreak.org/ | Last Journal: Friday June 09, @09:15PM)\nOkay, that's my rant.

Tom's grin can't hide his fear of Xenu.\nPhoto: Reuters\nThe site prefix is TheAge. Your browser does not support iframes. To visit the page follow this link\nIt's official: Tom Cruise is as mad as a cut snake. Forget global warming and the looming disintegration of democracy, the most pressing issue of the day in Cruiseland is the threat of invasion by � aliens.\nAccording to several mags this week, Cruise is building an "$11 million luxury underground bunker" at his property in Colorado so his family can survive an "alien invasion".\n"It's a self-contained underground shelter with high-tech air purifying system," Woman's Day reports. Other essential alien fighting features include a helipad and swimming pool.\nTurns out that Tom is petrified of some alien guy called Xenu, who, according to the teachings of Scientology, is a bit of a bastard (or "intergalactic warlord" in Scientology speak) with a serious bone to pick with Earth because um, he's just, err � really cranky with us or something.\n"Tom is tired of his beliefs being portrayed as nutty," says the mag. "As far as he's concerned, his ideas are totally reasonable and he's sick of having to justify them to non-believers."\nRightio. Better start digging under the garage then and stocking up on water bottles and tins of tomato soup.\nAfflicted with a similar reality-distorting condition is Pamela Anderson. NW reports that the world's most famous pair of double-E breasts has married her new boyfriend of six minutes, Rick Saloman, the internet porn filmmaker behind the Paris Hilton sex tape.\nThe quickie union comes about seven minutes after Pammy's last bikini-clad wedding, to Kid Rock, which lasted about one minute. At least Pam will be guaranteed a new acting gig - prepare for the net's newest sex tape sensation - Wham Bam, Thank You, Pam II.\nAgain. Gotta make a living somehow, guys.\nIt appears that Angelina Jolie has taken a leaf out of Pammy's book and invested in a new pair of "bullet boobs", according to Famous. The magazine arrived at this important conclusion after comparing a picture of the scrawny star looking flat-chested in June to a new pic of her sporting pointy Betty Page breasts. The mag even went so far as to "consult" a plastic surgeon to confirm its theory.\nBoobs aside, Ange has some other issues on her plate. She has become a bit of a lush, says Famous, making her prone to spontaneous collapse.\n"She doesn't eat so when she does drink, the booze hits her so hard she collapses," says the mag. No more wines for you, Ange, unless they're accompanied by a very large steak and pile of greasy chips.\nFamous quickly moves on to the ever-popular celebrity porn/sex tape beat, with the news that we're about to see a lot more of Demi Moore.\nHer toyboy husband, Ashton Kutcher, kept nude pics of Demi on his mobile phone, maybe so he didn't forget what her bum looked like when he ducked out of the house for a loaf of bread. That's fine if you're into that kind of thing, except that butter-fingers Kutcher lost his mobile during a recent trip to Spain.\nThe lucky bugger who found the phone, which was left in the back of a cab, could become the world's newest millionaire. He has offered the pics to the National Enquirer for $US1 million. Looks like we'll be getting to know Demi's bum, too, now.

What might our government buy if it suddenly had that much money dropped onto its lap every year?\nFor one thing, it might pay for the entire $7 billion annual increase in the State Children's Health Insurance Program that President Bush is threatening to veto because of its cost -- and there'd still be $35 billion left over.\nOr perhaps you'd hire 880,000 schoolteachers at the average U.S. teacher salary of $47,602 per year.\nOr give every one of our current teachers a 30 percent raise (at a cost of $15 billion, according to the American Federation of Teachers) and use what's left to take a $27 billion whack out of the federal deficit.\nOr use all $42 billion for a massive tax cut that would put an extra $140 in the pockets of every person in the country -- $560 for a family of four.\nThe mind reels at the ways such a massive sum of money could be put to use.\nWhy $42 billion? Because that's what our current marijuana laws cost American taxpayers each year, according to a new study by researcher Jon Gettman, Ph.D. -- $10.7 billion in direct law enforcement costs, and $31.1 billion in lost tax revenues. And that may be an underestimate, at least on the law enforcement side, since Gettman made his calculations before the FBI released its latest arrest statistics in late September. The new FBI stats show an all-time record 829,627 marijuana arrests in 2006, 43,000 more than in 2005.\nThat's like arresting every man, woman and child in the state of North Dakota plus every man, woman, and child in Des Moines, Iowa on marijuana charges ... every year. Arrests for marijuana possession -- not sales or trafficking, just possession -- totaled 738,916. By comparison, there were 611,523 arrests last year for all violent crimes combined.\nBasing his calculations mainly on U.S. government statistics, Gettman concludes that marijuana in the U.S. is a $113 billion dollar business. That's a huge chunk of economic activity that is unregulated and untaxed because it's almost entirely off the books.\nOf course, the cost of our marijuana laws goes far beyond lost tax revenues and money spent on law enforcement. By consigning a very popular product -- one that's been used by about 100 million Americans, according to government surveys -- to the criminal underground, we've effectively cut legitimate businesspeople out of the market and handed a monopoly to criminals and gangs.\nStrangely, government officials love to warn us that some unsavory characters profit off of marijuana sales, while ignoring the obvious: Our prohibitionist laws handed them the marijuana business in the first place, effectively giving marijuana dealers a $113 billion free ride.\nAll this might make some sense if marijuana were so terribly dangerous that it needed to be banned at all costs, but science long ago came to precisely the opposite conclusion. Compared to alcohol, for example, marijuana is astonishingly safe. For one thing, marijuana is much less addictive than alcohol, with just nine percent of users becoming dependent, as opposed to 15 percent for booze. And marijuana is much less toxic. Heavy drinking is well-documented to damage the brain and liver, and to increase the risk of many types of cancer. Marijuana, on the other hand, has never caused a medically documented overdose death, and scientists are still debating whether even heavy marijuana use causes any permanent harm at all. And then there's violence. Again, the scientific findings are overwhelming: Booze incites violence and aggression; marijuana doesn't.\nDespite all that, we now arrest one American every 38 seconds on marijuana charges. And we do so at a staggering cost in law enforcement expenses, lost tax revenues, and staggering profits for criminal gangs.\nThe alternative is clear: Regulate marijuana just as we do beer, wine, and liquor. The only thing lacking is the political will.\nSee more stories tagged with: drugs, marijuana legalization\nRob Kampia is executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, DC.\nDrugReporter � Story Tools: EMAIL PRINT 57 COMMENTS\nAdvertisement\nComments\nTurn comments off sitewide\nGive us feedback �\nTools: [Post a new comment] [Login] [Signup]\nView: Threaded Expand All Collapse All Flat Flat Unthreaded\npart of a bigger agenda\n[Report this comment] Posted by: anise on Oct 9, 2007 3:11 AM\nCurrent rating: 5 [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nThis so called drug war is part of a bigger agenda a slower train to Auswitz it is a silent weapon mostly aimed at Africans in America.

It is probably close to a trillion a year.\nDrugs are freely available right now after all the effort wasted to stamp them out.\nThe repeal of drug prohibition in its entirety drugs would be freely available just as they are now but they would be cheap, pure and available in known quantities and we could have more effective strategies for helping the small minority of users who ask for help.\nThe violence ,corruption of police and politicians, money laundering , drug fueled prostitution, funding of bad people with drug money...it would all end.\nRemember people...drug laws are a very new thing in general. The entire time humans have been on this planet have been free of drug laws and people used the drugs they wanted.\nAlso by dismantling the DEA who controls and approves all scientific research on controlled drugs new ways of treating addiction and new safe intoxicants could be developed.\nThe number of people who have problems with drugs will actually decrease and those who choose not to use intoxicants will not start using them and will not suffer the terrible effects of the WAR On SOME DRUGS. Police can focus on real crime, drug money violence and drug gangs will disappear and theft will drop as well.\nIt is a total positive gain for society as a whole.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: epeal ALL drug prohibition NOW Posted by: Chromedome2000\n� RE: epeal ALL drug prohibition NOW Posted by: Lauren\nLessons unlearned\n[Report this comment] Posted by: Basenjis on Oct 9, 2007 4:53 AM\nCurrent rating: 5 [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nWhen I was a child back in the dark ages, prohibition was in effect and so was rampant bootlegging. My father, a Democrat and a teetotaller, was against prohibition because he said it made criminals of ordinary people. My mother, a good Republican moralist, felt drinking was an evil that prohibition could cure.\nI never see it mentioned anywhere these days, but those who were pro prohibition in those days (largely Republicans), were labeled "dries," while those opposed to the government as keepers of the public morals, (largely Democrats) were called "wets" and the arguments between the two were hot and heavy. My parents were very political and even though I was a small child at the time, I had the advantage of hearing both sides to an important social and political issue. Eventually, of course, sanity ruled, the wets prevailed and prohibition was called a failure.\nSo now alcohol, a known killer, is sold legally, and Marijuana, with a record of having caused no deaths at all is illegal and anyone possessing a small amount is liable to imprisonment. Like my dad, I am a teetoteller also, but think prohibiting the use of Marijuana makes even less sense than prohibiting the use of alcohol. Marijuana is lumped in with the really dangerous drugs which makes no sense at all.\nOne day we may have our fill of the government treating its people like children and trying to save us from ourselves and insist enough is enough. We should have learned something from a failed prohibition policy years ago, but we seem to have a talent in this country for electing a lot of slow learners to positions of power. We haven't learned a thing.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: Lessons unlearned Posted by: Lauren\nUnderestimated!\n[Report this comment] Posted by: BlackbirdHighway on Oct 9, 2007 5:00 AM\nCurrent rating: 5 [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nThe cost is probably underestimated if it doesn't include things like crimes caused by robbers and violent criminals that could have been prevented if the cops weren't spending their time catching potheads. Also, crimes committed by other criminals that were released from prison early due to overcrowding caused of the incarceration of potheads.\nAlso, consider that it in many neighborhoods the cops are seen as the bad guys, and so people don't want to help in stopping criminal activity.\nDon't forget the hemp business that could be providing everything from paper products without killing old growth forests to alternative fuels. Both hemp and majihuana production could also lower the need farm subsidies by giving farmers a new cash crop.\nConsider too the benefits of regulating the strength of marijuana. Mnay of the present products are much too strong for casual use and render the uses too stoned to function. We don't have 100 proof beer for a reason, it's regulated.\nThen there is the benefit of keping it out of the hands of children. It is often easier for children to get marijuana than it is to get beer. The beer retailer doesn't want to lose his license by selling to underage buyers. The marijuana dealer doesn't have to worry about that.\nFinally, there is the issue of it being a "gateway drug". No, smoking marijuana doesn't automatically make people want to try harder drugs. Rather, since they have to go to a dealer of illegal drugs to buy it, it is quite likely that the dealer will also offer them other illegal drugs. You don't often go into a beer store, and have the clerk offer you cocaine or heroin.\nOk, that should be enough right there, except that our politicians are an extremely conservative bunch, so don't expect any changes. These ideas have been kicked around since the '70s, but instead of prgress, our laws have only gotton tougher. For some reason, we can't elect representatives who actually represent us.\nIt's a combination of conservatives showing up at the voting booth, while liberals don't. But it's not just laziness, most times liberals don't have anyone to vote for, except third parties, and the two major parties and media have everyone convinced that that would be "throwing away your vote".\nWhat I call throwing away your vote is voting for someone who does not reflect your views, or not voting at all. That is throwing away your vote. Whether your candidate wins or not is not material to your selection of who to vote for. Even worse, when the media tells you who is expected to win, and you take that into account when you vote, then you have just been manipulated! You are now voting for the media's choice, not your own. And the media is owned by big business, so don't be surprised when you find that everything seems slanted towards the needs of big business, and not the needs of the prople.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: Underestimated!

In 1989-1990, I was a pothead. I've been drug, alcohol, and caffeine free for over 16 years now, but when I told my friend Dennis Archer (serving time for a marijuana bust) back in 1993 that I had lived unwillingly under electronic surveillance, his immediate response was: "Did the government have you under surveillance for using drugs?"\nIn his 1992 book, Visions of Liberty, former Executive Director of the ACLU, Ira Glasser writes:\n"The use of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping emerged during the Prohibition era. Roy Olmstead was a suspected bootlegger whom the government wished to search. It placed taps in the basement of his office building and on wires in the streets near his home. No physical entry into his office or home took place. Olmstead was convicted entirely on the basis of evidence from the wiretaps.\n"In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Olmstead argued that the taps were a search conducted without a warrant and without probable cause, and that the evidence seized against him should have been excluded because it was illegally gathered. He also argued that his Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness against himself was violated.\n"By a 5-4 vote, the Court rejected his arguments and upheld the government's power to wiretap without limit and without any Fourth Amendment restrictions, on the grounds that no actual physical intrusion had taken place.\n"Olmstead's Fifth Amendment claim was also dismissed on the grounds that he had not been compelled to talk on the telephone, but had done so voluntarily. Thus the Court upheld the government's power to do by trickery and surreptitious means what it was not permitted to do honestly and openly. It wasn't until 1967, in a similar case involving gambling, that the Court overruled the Olmstead decision by an 8-1 margin and recognized that the Fourth Amendment applied to wiretapping and electronic surveillance.\n"Interestingly, these cases arose in the context of crimes like bootlegging and gambling. During the past twenty years, the majority of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping by both state and federal officials has been in cases involving drug dealing and gambling.\n"Serious crimes of violence, such as homicide, assault, rape, robbery, and burglary, are rarely the target of electronic eavesdropping, which is not normally a useful tool in such cases.\n"From the beginning, when wiretapping was virtually invented to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol, to the late 1960s, when gambling was a major target, to the present, when the use and sale of drugs other than alcohol are the main target, these intrusive devices have been used mostly to enforce laws aimed at punishing and proscribing personal conduct that society deems immoral.\n"Because such conduct essentially involves private activities among consenting adults who are all likely to want to keep those activities secret, they are harder to investigate and prosecute than crimes like robbery or burglary, in which an unwilling victim will probably aid any investigation...the invasion of privacy inherent in wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping remains with us as part of the legacy of our attempts to criminalize personal conduct.\n"The other major use of electronic eavesdropping has been to punish political dissent. For decades, former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover used wiretaps and other electronic devices to spy on political figures and citizens not yet suspected of having committed a crime. He built vast dossiers on their political activities and personal lives. Special units of local police called 'Red Squads' did the same."\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: modern day prohibition Posted by: bendinriver\nCivics 101\n[Report this comment] Posted by: Axiom69 on Oct 9, 2007 7:33 AM\nCurrent rating: 2 [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nThe United States is a nation of laws.

You can make bio-diesel,all clothing from work pants to wedding dresses,lubricating oils, #2 diesel fuel and a host of other products that would make the farm market price about $3500/ acre. That's just for the raw product,legal uses. Products that would be worth Hundreds of Billions of dollars in product sales. hemp would create hundreds of thousands of 'living wage' jobs,everything form dayworkers to scientists to engineers. Tradesmen would be employed to build the plants to process the raw fibers into clothing,fuel and foods.Family Farms could stay in business.\nSoils can be revitalized because hemp field waste is a natural fertilizer. Without even considering the 'pot smoker' mind set,\nthe money that could be generated by legalizing hemp far out 'earns' the deficits we get from interdiction.\nAllowing hemp medicines gives many people the right to buy from legal sources or grow their own. Allowing hemp to be available as alchohol would have a pacifying effect on the society as a whole. Domestic violence,the most common crime,would drop to nearly nothing.People would need less anti-depressants, mood elevators, and social anxiety drugs.\nBetween the legal uses and the medical uses,there's no real reason to keep hemp illegal,except for the vast amounts of money the government makes playing both ends against the middle. Hemp is a tool that's used to promote fear,at least as far as 'Uncle Screw You' is concerned. Funny thing though, The president's grand pappy wore baby clothes made from hemp. Used cold remedies made from hemp, lit lanterns that held hempoil. Worked the oilfields in pants made from hemp and buttoned a hemp shirt. Read books printed on hemp paper. Sat at the dinner table with a fine Irish hemp tablecloth\nwith hemp napkins. Too bad he clebrated his success with alchohol instead of joints. We might not have been 9/11'd. We may even had a more peaceful society that had more jobs,cleaner air and a stronger economy.\nJeffrey7\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: Let's think about the money.....for real Posted by: jmoore\nWho DID we vote for in 2006 ?????????????\n[Report this comment] Posted by: picket on Oct 9, 2007 10:04 AM\nCurrent rating: Not yet rated [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nThe people elected how many new Democratic Members in 2006 to the House of Representatives??\nIt is my understanding that only TWO new Democratic House Members voted for the Hinchey-Rohrabacher Amendment in July.

Exit polls are used to verify elections in most countries in Europe, since they still use paper ballots and it takes a couple of days for the official results to come in. Exit polls are usually accurate to less than one percent, and were accurate in the U. S. before the Republicans started their massive campaigns of fraud and voter suppression.

It's turned our police forces into quasi pari-military swat teams for dawn no knock kick in your door raids which sometimes lead to innocent people being killed to "save the children".\nOver 800,000 (you gotta be kidding) arrests for mostly possession of a substance that is much safer than booze. And please don't run that "oh it's 30 times as potent as your fathers pot" horsehockey by me. I've smoked pot for 40 years and the 5 most potent strains of pot I've smoked were all grown in the 70's (and that includes some very fine hydroponic strains in recent years) Besides the more potent the strain the less you have to smoke.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\nSince no one else mentioned his name:\n[Report this comment] Posted by: Iconoclast421 on Oct 9, 2007 11:26 AM\nCurrent rating: 1 [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nRon Paul 2008!!!\nduh.\nAnd yeah we're talkin way way wayyyyyy more than $42 billion here. I'm thinkin more like $500 billion altogether. The costs are hidden but certainly cannot be ignored. Just like how they say Iraq only costed a few hundred billion (lol, only). But then when you look at the war's effect on the price of oil and do a little math, it comes out to about $33 billion for every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil since 2003. This war on herb is extracting a similar hidden cost. We really need to declare war on something more logical. How about a war on crayola crayons? You know how many kids choke on those things?\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� Ron Paul: sexist and racist Posted by: goatini\nNot that much\n[Report this comment] Posted by: leafsong1 on Oct 9, 2007 11:44 AM\nCurrent rating: Not yet rated [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nA 113 billion dollar illegal business wouldn't be worth half that much if it were legal, and the cost of regulation would probably offset much of the revenue if it were legalized. I agree with the premise of the article, but using obviously inflated figures detracts from it's credibility.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\nthekidde\n[Report this comment] Posted by: thekidde on Oct 9, 2007 11:52 AM\nCurrent rating: Not yet rated [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nDecriminalize ALL drugs. Get the money out and crime, violence and the "lure" of drugs will decrease. Put 1/10th of this money into rehab and help programs for addicts, jobs, etc. and get real. Drugs, as terrorism, can't succumb to "war".

We must put an end to the attack on patients and providers!\nAmericans for Safe Access (ASA) has launched a pressure campaign, calling on Governor Schwarzenegger to "Stand Up for Patients' Rights: Defend California's Medical Marijuana Laws."\nWe are calling on Governor Schwarzenegger to defend the rights of medical cannabis patients and caregivers and the will of the voters in California by standing up to the Bush Administration. We are urging him to take a stand against federal medical cannabis enforcement and to support efforts to harmonize federal law with the compassionate laws of California and the eleven other states that allow medical cannabis use.\nASA's new campaign consists of statewide call in days, legislative visits from constituents and lobbyists, and sign-on letters from key public officials and organizations. This pressure will build up to a mass mobilization on Thursday, October 11th, to Governor Schwarzenegger's office in Los Angeles.\nThe only way this campaign will be successful is if people like you take action to protect California's patients, providers, and medical marijuana laws!

While I agree that the safe drugs like a little weed should be decriminalized I don't really believe that all drugs should be legal. Have you ever witnessed first hand what the effects of drugs like meth,coke,smack, and crack will do to people? I have and let me just say that it's not a pretty sight. Those drugs will turn you into someone who you never wanted to be, they will take you to the darkest places in your mind and not let you go back unless you quit. Can you imagine what this country would be like in twenty years if everyone would be allowed to run rampant on hard drugs? I don't even want to. What we need is to ask our leaders simply why Why is pot illegal, why are you allowing the hard drugs to be accesible, what I mean is, why are the ingredients to make those drugs, save for coke still in existence? we can survive without psuedoeffidrine, we can survive without anhydrous ammonia, just to name a few, we really need to think about this.

We need to keep pinning down the candidates and educating them about what we think. We also need to face the real beliefs of people that have lived with the drug scene in America. Their views are important and valuable. I am talking about both the bad and the good. We need to see all sides and force ourselves to think about what this war on drugs does to our country. A start in making this change to a healthy view of drug use a reality would be a petition asking that a general amnesty be declared so as to get the people caught in this war out of our overcrowded prisons. Another step we could and should make is to show some respect for ourselves. Let's give ourselves a chance, and the people who have been affected an opportunity, to learn the difference between treating recreational drug use as an adult choice and treating it as a vile crime. Using a recreational drug is a choice that millions of people make every day. But in our world, we also choose to make fun of this choice in the most horrible of ways. We can stop doing that.\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\nnothing learned from tobacco and alcohol???\n[Report this comment] Posted by: richholland on Oct 10, 2007 4:51 AM\nCurrent rating: Not yet rated [1 = poor; 5 = excellent]\nwhy on earth you want make production and sale of DRUGS legal???\nForgotten all the harm done by the Cancercompanies with there lousy cigarrettes???\nWhy not be happy with the knowledge that smoking pot will not put you in jail.\nAnd those minidealers find a regular job.\nIf haschies becomes legalized Prices go up .\n[� Reply to this comment] [Post a new comment �] [Rate this comment: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5]\n� RE: nothing learned from tobacco and alcohol???

Pump Contract to Be Probed Again\nBy CAIN BURDEAU Associated Press Writer\n� 2007 The Associated Press\nTOOLS\nEmail\nGet section feed\nPrint\nSubscribe NOW\nComments\nNEW ORLEANS ? A federal agency says there is "substantial likelihood" the Army Corps of Engineers acted improperly in handling a politically connected Florida company's $27 million flood-pump contract after Hurricane Katrina.\nThe Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that handles whistleblower complaints, has asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to respond to its review of allegations by Maria Garzino, an engineer who was one of dozens of Corps personnel brought to New Orleans after Katrina.\nGarzino was in charge of a team installing pumps manufactured by Moving Water Industries Corp. of Deerfield Beach, Fla.\nScott Bloch, head of the Office of Special Counsel, wrote in a Sept. 21 letter to Gates that "there is a substantial likelihood that the information Ms. Garzino provided discloses a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds and a substantial and specific danger to public safety."\nBy law, Gates must investigate the complaint and issue a report within 120 days.\nThe pumps became a black eye for the Corps after The Associated Press reported in March that the agency installed 34 pumps despite knowing the equipment was seriously flawed.\nThe problems with the pumps already have prompted an investigation by the Government Accountability Office and an internal review by the Corps. Those reviews found flaws with the equipment but no wrongdoing by Corps officials. The GAO, however, continues to look into the contract with MWI.\nOn Monday, MWI called Garzino's allegations unfounded.\n"We welcome any legitimate inquiry into the supply of our pumps in New Orleans since we are convinced that the pumps which we supplied will work as specified to protect the citizens of the city against another Katrina-like flood," the company said in a news release.\nIn a May 2006 memo to Corps leaders, Garzino warned the pumps were faulty and would break down if put to the task they were designed for: draining water from New Orleans during a hurricane.\nAccording to the Office of Special Counsel, Garzino alleges requirements to test the MWI pumps were eased without the approval of the contracting officer and that after she left New Orleans colleagues did "absolutely no further work" to fix problems she had found.\nInstead, Corps employees apparently were "focused on meeting time-sensitive deadlines instead of getting the task completed properly," according to the whistleblower disclosure report by the Office of Special Counsel.\nMWI's contract included a $5 million incentive to deliver the pumps by the start of the 2006 hurricane season. And Corps officials were under pressure to get New Orleans ready for the season, the first since Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans and revealed deep-seated organizational and engineering troubles within the Corps.\nMWI is owned by J. David Eller and his sons. Eller was once a business partner of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in a venture called Bush-El that marketed MWI pumps.\nThe Corps has added a new series of pumps on the canals built by different manufacturers to bolster pumping capacity. The Corps says the MWI pumps have passed multiple tests in recent months.\nGarzino, who's been a Corps engineer for nine years and works in its Los Angeles district, said she could not comment because the matter is under investigation.\nCorps officials in New Orleans did not immediately comment. Corps leaders have acknowledged there were flaws with the pumps, but insist the pumps would have worked adequately and that all remaining problems have been fixed.\nCOMMENTS\nReaders are solely responsible for the content of the comments they post here.

Will Rudy Giuliani be Bush III?\nMatt TaibbiPosted May 31, 2007 8:59 AM\nPage 1 2 3 4\n>> See what people are saying about Taibbi's latest column and add your own response here.\nEarly Wednesday, May 16th, Charleston, South Carolina. The scene is a town-hall meeting staged by GOP presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, only a day after he wowed a patriotic Republican crowd at a nationally televised debate with a righteous ass-kicking of the party's latest Hanoi Jane, terrorist sympathizer Ron Paul. A bump in the polls later, "America's Mayor" is back on the campaign trail -- in a room packed with standard-issue Adorable Schoolchildren, in this case beatific black kids in elementary school uniforms with wide eyes and big RUDY stickers pinned to their oblivious breasts.\nGiuliani has good stage presence, but his physical appearance is problematic -- virtually neckless, all shoulders and forehead and overbite, with a hunched-over, Draculoid posture that recalls, oddly enough, George W. Bush, the vestigial stoop of a once-chubby kid who grew up hiding tittie pictures from nuns. Not handsome, not cuddly, if he wins this thing it's going to be by projecting toughness and man-aura. But all presidential candidates have to play the baby-kissing game, and here is an early chance for Rudy to show his softer side.\n"So," he whispers to the kids. "What do you all want to be when you grow up? Do any of you know?"\nA bucktoothed boy raises his hand.\n"I wanna be a doctor," he says, "and a lawyer."\nThe crowd laughs, then looks at Rudy expectantly. The obvious line is "A doctor and a lawyer? Whaddya want to do, sue yourself?" and you can see Rudy physically straining for the joke. But this candidate's funny bone is a microscopic thing, like one of those anvil-shaped deals in the ear, and the line eludes him.\n"A doctor and a lawyer, huh?" he says, grinning nervously. "Uh . . . whaddya want to do, sue the doctor?"\nMy notes from that moment read: Chirping crickets.\nRudy moves on. "How about you?" he says to the next boy.\n"I want to be a policeman!" the kid says.\nRudy smiles. Then the next boy says he wants to be a fireman, and the crowd twitters: Wow, a fireman and a policeman, in the same room!

So, at different carbon prices, different sorts of methods of abatement become worthwhile. Vattenfall, a Swedish power utility, has tried to quantify which ones would be worth undertaking at what price (see chart 3).\nThe result is a testament to economic irrationality. The measures below the horizontal line have a negative abatement cost?in other words, by carrying them out, people and companies could both cut emissions and save money. At a macroeconomic level they would boost, rather than reduce, economic growth.\nLighting, for instance, accounts for some 19% of the world's electricity use. A standard incandescent light bulb costs around ?1, says Theo van Deursen, chief executive of Philips Lighting, and uses ?15-worth of electricity a year. A low-energy one costs ?5-6 and uses ?3-worth. The payback on investing in a compact fluorescent bulb, therefore, is less than a year. Yet low-energy lighting makes up only 30% of Philips's sales. Mr van Deursen admits to being disappointed. Sales are rising faster in the developing world: there, people pay more attention to electricity bills than they do in the rich world.\nEconomists trying to explain this apparent irrationality suggest that the savings are too small and the effort involved in change too large. People find their electricity bills too boring to think about; within companies, those responsible for keeping bills down may not have the authority to spend the necessary capital. Another explanation is the agency problem: that the developer who would have to pay higher capital costs up front will not be forking out for the electricity bills. Besides, people buy houses not because they have good insulation but because they have pretty views.\nCompared with pursuing greater energy efficiency, the abatement measures into which so much money is now being poured look rather expensive. Carbon capture and storage and wind and solar power, for instance, all have positive, and relatively high, abatement costs.\nBut the cheapest sources of abatement are difficult for policymakers to get at. Billions of different actors are involved. They cannot be targeted in the way that a few hundred factories can. What is more, a moderate carbon price is not likely to be effective, since people clearly do not care enough about cost.\nOne policy option is to decouple the utilities' revenues from the amount of electricity they sell. That gives them an incentive to increase the efficiency of power usage rather than to produce and sell extra power. California is already doing this, which is presumably why electricity prices there are among the highest in America, while consumption is relatively low.\nEnergy-efficiency standards, such as building regulations, are another option. Economists generally prefer to avoid rules that specify what companies can produce and how, because they require governments, rather than markets, to allocate resources, and markets tend to do a better job. But if, as in this case, a public as well as a private good is involved, and the market does not seem to be doing its job properly, there is an argument for governments giving it a nudge.\nThere are lots of energy-efficiency regulations in place already, and they are being tightened. Incandescent light bulbs are the top target at the moment. Both the European Union and Australia said earlier this year that they are planning to ban them. But the man in the vanguard of this green revolution is Fidel Castro, who started phasing them out two years ago.\nNext article �\nPrintable page\nE-mail this\nBuy PDF\nBookmark\nRelated Items\nIn this special report\nCleaning up\nEverybody's green now\nTrading thin air\nIrrational incandescence\nFairfield v the valley\nSunlit uplands\nBoom\nDirty king coal\nThe drive for low emissions\nThe final cut\nAudio interview\nSources\nOffer to readers\nMore articles about...\nElectricity\nThe environment\nEconomics\nWebsites\nTheo van Deursen (see also Philips's lighting information), Vattenfall\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nClassified ads\nJobs\nSenior Economist THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, INC.

29	The hell that is Zimbabwe	SW Radio Africa - Cathy Buckle\nFACT SHEET ?\nTHE ZIMBABWEAN CRISIS\nPopulation\n1. Estimated population in 2000: between 12.5 and 13 million\n2. Current estimates indicate the population could be as low as 8 million\nEconomic Collapse\n1. The world?s fastest shrinking economy\n2. 1996 GDP growth of 10%; 200 GDP expected to decline by 12 per cent.\n3. GDP shrank by 42% between 1998 and 2006\n4. Exports: R 50 billion in 1997, R 9 billion in 2007\n5. World's highest rate of inflation: 20% in 1997 now in excess of 5 000%, (The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe calculates the rate of inflation for June 2007 as more than 13 000% for an urban family of six). Private sector estimates put inflation at 22 000 per cent in October 2007.\n6. World Bank: "The Zimbabwean economic meltdown is the worst outside a\nwar zone"\n7. Fifth on the World Failed States Index after Somalia, North Korea etc.\n8. Zimbabwe ranks last of 130 countries on the Fraser Institute?s Annual Economic Freedom of the World Report.\n9. Zimbabwe is ranked 151 out of 177 countries on the United Nations Development Programme?s Human Development Index\n10. The Zimbabwe dollar was devalued in August 2006 by 60%, three zeros were removed from the currency and the new official exchange rate to the US$ was set at 250:1. The parallel market exchange rate has gone up from Z$1 500 in August 2006 to its current (mid-October 2007) rate of about Z$500 000.\n11. During October 2007, the parallel market exchange rate for one US$ reached Z$500 000.\nAnnual inflation rates in Zimbabwe\nMonth\nRate\nNovember 2006\n1,099%\nDecember 2006\n1,281%\nJanuary 2007\n1,594%\nFebruary 2007\n1,730%\nMarch 2007\n2,200%\nApril 2007\n3,714%\nIndustrial Sector\nIndustrial productivity is now below 30% of capacity\nMore than 5 000 executives, businessmen and managers have been arrested and fined for defying a government edict in June to slash all prices by around 50%.\nIn 1980 there were 102 diesel locomotive in operation on the National Railways; today there are just 11.\nAgricultural Sector\n1. Up to 70% of commercial agriculture has been destroyed\n2. Large-scale commercial maize (corn) production now accounts for less than 5% of the country?s total maize production.\n3. Only an estimated 10% of the country's winter wheat crop had been planted due to shortages of fuel and fertilizer\n4. National cereal production is down 44% on 2006.\n5. The maize harvest estimate is 799 000 tonnes (46% down on 2006)\n6. 2.1 million people (urban and rural) will require food aid from July 2007\n7. 4.1 million people (urban and rural) will require food aid from January 2008\nAn estimated 150 000 former farm labourers are in need of food aid because they lost their livelihoods following the chaotic and violent take-over of the commercial farms\nZimbabwe has been named as one of the Global Hunger Hotspots by the World Food Programme.\nTourism Sector\n1. Zimbabwe?s tourism industry was one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in the country with an annual average growth rate of 18.5% (tourist arrivals) from 1989 to 1998.\n2. Tourism receipts increased by an average annual growth rate of 25% over the same period. In 1998, the industry was estimated to be employing 180 000 people, both directly and indirectly.\n3. Zimbabwe's revenues from tourism fell from US$700m (�375m) in 1999, to just US$60m in 2004.\nUnemployment\nOver 85% unemployment. The disruption of the business sector through chaotic price controls will further escalate unemployment levels.\nEmigration / Brain Drain / Refugee Crisis\n1. 75% of Zimbabweans with a job are employed outside their country.\n2. 25% of all Zimbabweans are in political or economic exile ? the biggest proportional mass movement of a population in peacetime ever in\nmodern history.\n3. Brain drain: In 2005, a study by the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC) reported that close to 500 000 of Zimbabwe's "professional cream" had left in recent years to work abroad. However, the study noted that the figure could be a "gross under-estimation" of the real number of Zimbabwean workers in the diaspora.\n4. Between 3,5 and 4,5 million Zimbabweans exiles are estimated to be in South Africa where the majority struggle to survive and send money and food home.\n5. In July it was estimated that between 3 000 and 4 000 Zimbabweans are crossing into South Africa every day. This represents at least 100 000 people a month, far more than official South African estimates of 20 000 per month. Forced migration is accelerating at present (October 2007).\n6. The International Organisation for Migration, which opened an office to assist deported Zimbabwean refugees on the northern side of the border, says the organisation is handling on average 17 000 deportees every month. It is estimates that more than 86 000 illegal immigrants were forcibly repatriated between January and May this year alone. (It is important to note that the figure of 17 000 per month excludes those refugees who have managed to evade the South African authorities).\n7. The Registrar-General?s Office announced recently that the cost of an ordinary Zimbabwean passport has been hiked 29 990% to Z$150 000 from Z$500. A passport processed within 24 hours costs Z$1 million.\nLiving Standards\n1. 45% of the population is malnourished, one of the highest rates in the world\n2. At the end of 2006, the average minimum wage of Zimbabwean workers was\nonly 16.6% of the Poverty Datum Line calculated at December 2006 levels\n3. Four out of five Zimbabweans now live below the breadline.\nHealth\n1. Official statistics estimate that HIV/AIDS is present in 24.6% of the adult population (2001), putting the country in the top tier of all countries. That?s close to 1 in 4 people in Zimbabwe living with AIDS.\n2. However, HIV infection rates may be as high as 40% given that the population was an estimated 12.5 million in 2000, but more than 5 million Zimbabweans have fled the country.\n3. Tuberculosis is common in all developing countries. However, Zimbabwe has a prevalence of over 100 cases per 100 000 population, the highest WHO risk category. In 1980 TB had virtually been eradicated in Zimbabwe.\n4. Life expectancy for women is just 34 years\n5. Life expectancy for men is just 37 years\n6. Zimbabwe now has the highest number of orphans per capita in the world ? in excess of 1.6 million.\n7. AIDS-related deaths orphan another 350 children every single day.\n8. Two thirds of female-headed households care for orphans and vulnerable children.\n9. The healthcare sector is in virtual collapse. Estimated that over 40,000 Zimbabwe Nurses are working outside the country.\n10. Number of doctors per 10 000 people: 1 (World Health Organisation statistic 2006)\n11. According to health ministry statistics in Zimbabwe, fewer than one in four posts for doctors is occupied\n12. Four out of five of the district hospitals that serve rural areas have no doctors\n13. Average deaths per week: 3 500. (This statistic may be much higher as deaths in rural areas are increasingly not reported and people either cannot afford the bus fare to take family members to hospital or see no point in doing so since hospitals and clinics have largely run out of drugs.)\n14. British Medical Journal ranks Zimbabwe as worst in the world in terms of Health and placing Zimbabwe at bottom of WHO list of 191 nations.\nHuman Rights\nOver 20 000 documented murders by the Zimbabwe government during the Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland of the mid 1980s\n1 in 10 people in Matabeleland over the age of 30 are survivors of torture\n1 in 10 Zimbabweans now need psychological help\nTens of thousands of people of Malawian extraction, mainly farm workers have been forced out of the country\nInternationally recorded human rights abuses (15 000 in eight years) up by 50% over last year\nThe victimisation of MDC leaders and activists has been ongoing and has intensified since 11 March 2007, with provincial and local activists affiliated to the MDC being specifically targeted. Victims of torture are being detained, denied access to medical attention and access to their lawyers because of their political affiliation and are afraid to seek medical attention for fear of further beatings.\nBy the end of September, as many as 500 MDC members had been seriously beaten up and tortured or, with the number of total individuals exceeding 900, since March 11th 2007.\nOperation Murambatsvina\n1. Operation Murambatsvina (2005), the government?s ruthless programme to destroy largely informal urban homes and force people into the rural areas rendered more than 700 000 people left homeless or jobless.\n2.4 million poor people were affected. (Statistics from UN report)\nOperation Murambatsvina also resulted in the destruction of at least 32 500 small and micro-businesses across the country, creating a loss of livelihood for more than 96 600 people (mostly women).\nMugabe?s Mansions\n1. Located 16 km north of Harare, Mugabe?s 25 en suite bedroom mansion is the size of a medium-sized hotel.\n2. Building the mansion has cost in excess of US$ 26 million in a country where most people earn less than the equivalent of eleven dollars a month.\n3. More than 2 000 bags of cement meant for the victims of Operation Murambatsvina were diverted to ongoing building operations at the Mugabe mansion.\n4. This is the third luxury residence that Mugabe has built and the fifth he has owned since he came to power.\n5. In 2003, Mugabe and his wife Grace also took over the magnificent Iron Mask farm in the Mazowe area from elderly white commercial farmers. The owners were given 48 hours to leave the property after a visit by Grace Mugabe, accompanied by police, soldiers and youth militia.\nEnvironment/wildlife\n1. Over 80% of the wildlife on commercial farms and conservancies has been destroyed\n2. The total losses of wildlife on private game ranches is estimated to be over 90%, a total of about 560 000 animals.\n3. Prior to the so-called land reform programme, there were 15 conservancies. Today there are only two left of any consequence.\n4. Poaching is endemic in the national parks.\n5. The decimation of the gene pools of wildlife and domestic animals will impact on the country for generations.	2007-10-10 00:00:00	http://reddit.com/goto?rss=true&id=2ylu8	1
30	If you're a Jew, the Hitler mustache exists in the eternal present. I grew it for the same reason Richard Pryor said the word "nigger." I wanted to defuse it.	Becoming Adolf: Entertainment & Culture: vanityfair.com\nSkip to content\nPreview the current issue of Vanity Fair\nEntertainment & Culture\nPolitics & Issues\nFame & Scandal\nOn the Web\nThe Magazine\nVanity Fair\nEntertainment & Culture\nE-Mail Print RSS\nIdea Lab\nThe Toothbrush mustache will forever be associated with its famous wearer, Adolf Hitler. By Heinrich Hoffmann/Corbis.\nBecoming Adolf\nHitler's Toothbrush mustache is one of the most powerful symbols of the last century, an inch of hair that represents infinite evil. The author had his reasons for deciding to wear one.\nby Rich Cohen November 2007\nI decided to grow a Toothbrush mustache. Well, that's not what I called it. Until I started this story, I had only one name for the thing in mind: a Hitler mustache. An inch of hair that speaks of bottomless evil. A few nights earlier, I had seen Richard Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion, interviewed by Bill O'Reilly, who, citing Stalin and Hitler, said he thought atheists, because of their lack of restraining faith, were more susceptible to evil. To which Dawkins (in essence) replied: both Stalin and Hitler wore mustaches?do we therefore think the mustache was the cause of their behavior? I experienced this as an epiphany: By Jove! I said to myself. It was the mustache! From that moment, I stopped shaving. From that moment, I started reading. From that moment, I became wrapped up in facial hair, and the role it has played in politics. The Toothbrush mustache offered a new way to look at the past. It was a pinprick through which I could see the old scene from a fresh angle. It was the history of our time retold as the story of the 'stache.\nThe Toothbrush mustache is the most powerful configuration of facial hair the world has ever known. It overpowers whoever touches it. By merely doodling a Toothbrush mustache on a poster, you make a political statement. Actually wearing a Hitler mustache, as I planned to do?well, that is like yelling racial epithets in a crowded subway. Wasn't Hitler amazing? Whatever he touched turned to ice. His life ended the long and fabled career of the name Adolf, which had included the stories of Adolph Zukor, Adolphe Menjou, Adolph Ochs, and Adolph Coors. Never again will a pregnant mother innocently consider the name for her son, or imagine shouting it across a teeming playground. As for the Toothbrush mustache, it did not only die with the F�hrer?it was embalmed with him. It was his essence, and so it has been relegated to the black book of history.\nThis is the part where I am supposed to explain just why I decided to write this story now. I might talk about the re-emergence of facial hair on the world stage, or the rise of the "new anti-Semitism," or Holocaust denial in Iran, but, the fact is, my interest in the Hitler mustache never started and never ends. It is always. If you're a Jew, the Hitler mustache exists in the eternal present. I grew it for the same reason Richard Pryor said the word "nigger." I wanted to defuse it. I wanted to own it. I wanted to reclaim it for America and for the Jews. My name is Rich Cohen, and I wear a Hitler mustache.\nThe Imperial, the Walrus, the Stromboli, the Handlebar, the Horseshoe, the Mustachio (also called the Nosebeard or the Fantastico), the Pencil, also called (by idiots) the Mouthbrow?the catalogue is illustrious. (The history of the razor is longer than the history of the mustache, but only by a few minutes.) Most mustaches lie waiting for some Clark Gable or Tom Selleck to fix them in the mind. The greatest are identified with a single man, a bad man, usually, who so wrapped his identity with a particular configuration of facial hair that the two became inseparable. Like the Fu Manchu, in which long tresses hang to the chin, where they can be stroked as the madman laughs. It is named for Sax Rohmer's (racist) villain from the golden age of Hollywood, the bad guy from the B movies who became a symbol for the creeping Asian menace. Or think of the long, droopy Pancho Villa. It was worn by the pistol-flashing Mexican bandito as he chased gringos through the border towns along the Rio Grande. These days, you see it only on Halloween, or at reunion shows of Crosby, Stills & Nash.\nThe Toothbrush mustache was first introduced in Germany by Americans, who turned up with it at the end of the 19th century the way Americans would turn up with ducktails in the 1950s. It was a bit of modern efficiency, an answer to the ornate mustaches of Europe?pop effluvia that fell into the grip of a bad, bad man.[1] Before that, the most popular mustache in Germany and Austria had been the sort worn by the royals. It was called the Kaiser, and it was elaborate. It was perfumed, styled, teased and trained. It turned up at the ends. It was the old, monarchical world that was about to be crushed by the rising tide of assembly-line America. In other words, in the case of Hitler and his 'stache, America faced an extreme case of blowback.\nBy the beginning of the century, it had been taken up by enough Germans to draw notice in the foreign press. In 1907, The New York Times chronicled a growing distaste for the import under the headline "toothbrush" mustache: german women resent its usurpation of the "kaiserbart."\nIn the years before the First World War, the Toothbrush was taken up by a German folk hero, which is the moment it became a craze. Before that, it had been an elite fashion shared by the dandies and swells of Berlin and Vienna. After that, it was worn by every yokel who dreamed of greatness. I am imagining young Hitler poring over newspapers in search of any mention of Hans Koeppen, a Prussian lieutenant who had become a pop star in the manner of the solo aviator, the illusionist, or the tightrope walker. Here is how he was described in The New York Times: "Lieut. Koeppen is 31 years old and unmarried. Six feet in height, slim and athletic, with a toothbrush mustache characteristic of his class."\nThe moment he appeared in the press with the Toothbrush mustache is like the moment Michael Jordan appeared on the basketball court in Bermuda-length shorts, changing the look of the game forever. In early 1908, Koeppen was given leave from the Prussian Army to cover a New York?to?Paris motor race for Zeitung am Mittag, a German newspaper. When I think of the Hitler who must have followed this race, because it was followed by everyone, I think of the Hitler who loved cars and built the autobahn. (As opposed to the Hitler who killed the Gypsies and the Jews.)\nAfter a disagreement with the German drivers, Koeppen took over. By the time he left Vladivostok, he was a star. The Times: "When he dashes across the German frontier from Russia ? the tall, trim young infantry officer"?with the Toothbrush mustache?"may count upon a greeting hardly less joyful than if he were returning from victorious battle."\nBy the end of the war, the Toothbrush mustache was being sported even by the defeated royals. A last image of the Old World is captured in pictures taken in November 1918, when William Hohenzollern Jr., the son of the Kaiser, the heir to an office that had ceased to exist, was sent into exile. He stands on the deck of an imperial steamer. He wears shiny boots, a greatcoat, a military cap, and a Toothbrush mustache. When he turns to look at the people crowding the shore, showing them only his Toothbrush mustache, he is showing them a picture of their future.\nE-Mail Print RSS\nPage of 3 > >|\ndigg thisadd to del.icio.usadd to reddit\nArchive\nNovember 2007: Rich Cohen on Hitler's mustache\nNovember 2007: Tom Stoppard on Syd Barrett and "Rock 'n' Roll"\nMarch 2001: George Gurley on Pleasures of the Fur\nMay 2006: Proust Questionnaire: Edward M.

Roll Call reports (sub req'd):\nThough Lieberman said he gets "angry when I hear about fraud or corruption in the spending of American dollars," he said he in part chooses what to have hearings on by "watching who else is doing what," noting that [House oversight chairman Henry] Waxman has held several hearings on Iraq oversight, as have the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees.\n"You've got to set your own priorities, and it was clear to me that other committees were going to pick this up," said Lieberman.\nRoll Call notes that on the day Iraq revoked Blackwater's license after the shooting of 17 civilians, Waxman immediately announced hearings on private security contractors. Lieberman "announced two firefighting grants for the towns of Bolton and Willington in his home state."\nLieberman has held only one hearing all year on "reconstruction challenges in both Iraq and Afghanistan," compared to eight hearings on Iraq and contracting abuses in the House.\nBreaking Politics News\n' + '\n' + ad.line2 + ' ' + ad.line3 + '' + '\n' + ad.visible_url + ''; } function google_ad_request_done(google_ads) { var s = ''; var i; if (google_ads.length == 0) return; s += "\n"; s += 'Ads by Google'; for(i = 0; i < google_ads.length; ++i) s += google_ad_construct_link(google_ads[i]); s+= ""; document.write(s); return; } google_ad_client = "pub-3264687723376607"; google_ad_channel = "3133837491"; google_ad_output = 'js'; google_max_num_ads = '1'; google_ad_type = 'text'; google_feedback = 'on';\nComments (36)\n0 comments pending\nFAQ: Comments & Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts\nPost a comment\nBetterDeadthanRedState (See profile | I'm a fan of BetterDeadthanRedState)\nHe's too busy investigating the inside of his ass.\nReply | Flag as abusive'); | posted 11:29 am on 10/10/2007\nNoFactsJustTruth (See profile | I'm a fan of NoFactsJustTruth)\nLIEberman's position as chair of 'oversight' was the Senate democraps echoing Speaker pelosi's "...off the table".\nHaving kept his Connecticut seat AS A REPUBLISCUM, with republiscum votes, of course he would not investigate the administration.\nTHIS democrap party HAS NO INTEREST in changing how business has been or is being conducted in OUR government.

News Only News Photos Video/Audio Advanced\nDebate in US over keeping drinking age at 21\nWed Oct 10, 8:38 AM ET\nWASHINGTON (AFP) - US health and safety groups teamed up Tuesday in an effort to keep the legal drinking age at 21 amid a campaign from a small activist group to let Americans legally consume alcohol from age 18.\nADVERTISEMENT\n');\nThe advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), the American Medical Association (AMA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) announced the creation of the Support 21 coalition to fight for the current drinking age law.\nMADD chief executive Chuck Hurley said the coalition was formed to counterbalance the media attention being given to "Choose Responsibility," a small activist group based in the university town of Middlebury, Vermont.\nHurley, whose organization was a driving force in getting the legal drinking age across the United States raised to 21 in 1984, warned that lowering the age to 18 would lead to more binge drinking among America's youngsters.\n"Everything in science indicates that the drinking age didn't cause binge drinking and will make it worse if it's lowered," Hurley told AFP after the press conference announcing the coalition.\nSupport 21 also cited "almost 50 peer-reviewed studies ... which found that an increased drinking age significantly lowers alcohol-related fatalities."\nNTSB chairman Mark Rosenker said his agency has long advocated laws that prevent people younger than 21 from drinking and that it has "not identified any new information that merits changing the Board's position."\n"Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death and alcohol the leading drug of choice for teenagers," he said.\nWhile 50 peer reviewed studies strongly support keeping the current drinking age, only one supports Choose Responsibility's position, Hurley said.\n"This is about science. We're talking about life and death here," Hurley said, accusing Choose Responsibility of distorting facts to suit its arguments.\nBut John McCardell, head of Choose Responsibility, dismissed the accusations.\n"They always say that we talk off the cuff and we have opinions masquerading as facts," McCardell, who was president of Middlebury College for 10 years, told AFP.\n"They will tell you that 52 studies show a direct relationship between the drinking age and alcohol-related fatalities," he said. "But the rest of the story is that there are an equal number of studies that show no relationship."\nHis assistant, Amanda Goodwin, said the studies were from the same article in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol from which MADD drew its peer-reviewed studies.\nChoose Responsibility agreed with MADD that the number of alcohol-related traffic deaths has gone down since the legal drinking age was raised to 21.\n"But the decline began before the drinking age law was changed and has occurred in every age group," McCardell said.\n"If we are going to talk about lives lost to alcohol, let's talk about lives lost to alcohol, wherever," he said.\n"Peer reviewed research has shown that more than 1,000 lives a year of 18 to 24 year olds are lost to alcohol off the highways.\n"Those deaths are not taking place out in the open, in restaurants or bars or large public gatherings because the law will not allow that. The only place they can be occurring is those places where the law has sent them -- into dark corners and behind closed doors."\nEmail Story\nIM Story\nPrintable View\nRECOMMEND THIS STORY\nRecommend It: Not at All Somewhat Moderately Highly Very Highly\nAverage (Not Rated)\n� Recommended Stories\nU.S. News\nLawyer: Atlantic City mayor resigns AP\nDevlin pleads to kidnapping, sodomy AP\nWis. town tries to recover after rampage AP\nCraig's `wide stance' enters lexicon AP\nLives of plane crash victims remembered AP\nMost Viewed - U.S.\nLawyer: Atlantic City mayor resigns AP\nWestern Pa. man has coveted Batman comic AP\nGov't may buy thousands of Miss. homes AP\nWinter seen warmer than normal Reuters\nStudy examines public, private schools AP\nU.S. Video\nMissing mayor at home after stay in clinic AP - Wed Oct 10, 3:36 AM ET\nSymbol of Hate ABC News - 1 hour, 19 minutes ago\nChild Kidnapper Gets Life ABC News - 1 hour, 19 minutes ago\nSpecial Olympics 2007 ABC News - 1 hour, 18 minutes ago\nSponsored Links\n( What's this? )\nHouse Payments Fall Again\n$180,000 Mortgage for $999/mo.

A Statistical Profile Tuesday, 9th October 2007 (by J.D.)\nThis article is about Career\nIf you're new here, you may want to learn what this site is about. I encourage you to subscribe to my RSS feed. Thanks for visiting!\nThere?s been some discussion recently among moneybloggers about writing more for those who earn the minimum wage, and for those who face other financial difficulties. This is a good thing. But all this talk made me wonder: How prevalent is the minimum wage? Who works minimum wage jobs? I decided to do some research.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the median annual income of a U.S. worker is $32,140. Federal minimum wage is currently $5.85 an hour, or about $11,500 per year ? just above the poverty line. Of the 76.5 million people paid by the hour in the United States in 2006, 2.2% make minimum wage or less. Here are some generalizations we can make about minimum wage workers:\nMost minimum wage earners are young. While 2.2% of all hourly workers earn minimum wage or less, just 1.4% of workers over the age of 25 are paid at or below the Federal minimum wage. More than half (51.2%) of minimum wage workers are between 16 and 24 years old. Another 21.2% are between 25 and 34.\nMost minimum wage earners work in food service. Nearly two-thirds of those paid minimum wage (or less) are food service workers. Many of these people receive supplemental income in the form of tips, which the government does not track.\nMost minimum wage earners never attended college. Just 1.2% of college graduates are paid the minimum wage. If you only have a high school degree, you?re more likely (1.9%) to be paid minimum wage. Those without a high school degree are nearly three times as likely (3.7%) to earn minimum wage. 59.8% of all minimum wage workers have no advanced education.\nFinally, as you might expect, part-time workers are five times more likely to be paid the minimum wage than full-time workers.\nYou can find more information at the official characteristics of minimum wage workers page, and in the page of data tables. Also, the Department of Labor has a map that shows how state minimum wage rates compare to Federal minimum wage rates:\nThese statistics mirror my own experience. When I earned minimum wage, I was working on farms or in restaurants. I was young. The other people I knew who earned minimum wage were also young. As an adult, I?ve known a few people who earned at (or just above) minimum wage. These people have usually lacked a college education. In many cases, they were actually working toward some sort of degree while they worked their minimum wage job. Most people don?t see a minimum wage job as an end, but as a means to an end.\nThat?s not to say that there aren?t those who aren?t stuck in bad situations. Research from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates:\nMany workers begin their post-school careers in jobs paying the minimum or something close to it, but?the vast majority of workers move on to higher paying jobs as they accumulate experience. However, there is a nontrivial fraction of workers who spend substantial portions of their early careers consistently working in minimum wage jobs. [?] Less educated persons, blacks, women with young children, and workers who reside outside of urban areas are much more likely to have such minimum wage careers.\nThe percentage of hourly workers paid at or below the Federal minimum wage has declined steadily (and significantly) since the numbers were first tracked in 1979. In 1980 and 1981, 15.1% of workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. In 2006, just 2.2% of workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. (A strong argument could be made that the minimum wage has failed to keep pace with the cost of living, and that employers have been raising wages on their own. In other words, this statistic may be meaningless.)\nEnough numbers! Later today I?ll explore ways for those trapped in minimum wage jobs to get ahead. It?s not all about pinching pennies. I?d also like to hear stories from people who have worked minimum wage jobs in the past, and from those who still do. If I collect enough stories, I?ll post them in a separate entry. (If you?d like to share your story, please drop me a line, or post it in this forum thread.)\n(1 votes, average: 5 out of 5)\nLoading ...\nYou may also be interested to read:\nBreaking the Shackles: How to Escape from Minimum Wage\nSaving Money vs. Making Money\nlinks for 2006-10-29\nReader Survey: How Do You Cope with a Limited Income?\nVoluntary Frugality vs. Frugality of Need\n29 Responses to ?Who Earns Minimum Wage? A Statistical Profile?\nAmanda Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 6:04 am\nFirstly, food service does not necessarily mean you?re working in a restaurant where you get tips. Working in a cafeteria or McDonalds is food service without tips. Working in a deli or bakery is food service without tips.\nSecondly, you *are* required to pay taxes on tips. Taxes are usually determined by the cost of the meal assigned to you. Which means that you ?win? if you get higher than average tips & lose if you get lower than average tips. Also, minimum wage for working where tips are an expected part of your income is lower than minimum wage elsewhere.\nIdeaSenator Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 6:25 am\nToday I have a job that gets me 60K. However 3 months ago when I was in transition and was looking for a job, I worked over the weekends for a food business for 5/hour. I worked 30 hours in those 3 days for 4 weeks. Although there was no necessity for me to do this, but pinching my own savings was ridiculous to me. So doing this was sort of a temporary fund coming in to cover my basic expenses. However what I realised was that for the others who worked there this was a lifetime job and there was no way out for them. They struggle to make ends meet and I appreciate the effort and struggles they put into their work. They were so good at managing their money and were able to live by with that little that they earned. It changed me even more after that.\nSteve Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 6:47 am\nFirstly, earning the minimum wage is not a ?financial difficulty? it is a ?motivation and brain power difficulty?. Ask anyone who writes in about earning the minimum wage (those who earn tip excluded) for more than 6 months to a year if they have ever ASKED for a raise. Ask them if they have done anything above and beyond the bare minimum that was required of them at work to stand out from the crowd and deserve a raise. Ask them, if after months with no raise, they looked around their town for other jobs, or merely moped all day long about how ?unlucky? they are to be ?trapped? in a low-paying job.\nSecondly, Amanda, you are only required to pay taxes on credit card tips, because the government can track those electronically. My brother, who is a server, loves getting cash tips because he only has to claim about 10% of the cash he actually earns to keep the IRS at bay. This idea of ?winning? if you get higher than average tips does not fly. You don?t ?win? tips, you earn them by being a hard worker and serving your guests better than somebody else would.\nJerry Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:07 am\nEven though most employers raise wages on their own, it is often not enough to keep pace with the cost of living. I urge you to watch a documentary called ?The High cost of a low price.? Probably can rent it at blockbuster for a dollar or two as it?s a documentary, or buy it on Amazon for $10.00. Once people watch this then they may see a little more into why people who work for minimum wage, or more at these larger organizations still have a hard time making ends meet.\nFinanceAndFat Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:13 am\nIf you are earning minimum wage you absolutely have to do something to get beyond that. Take classes, read books, get a second job. There is no way a person could survive on that money. If someone is willing to settle for that long term, there is nothing a personal finance blog can do to help them.\nSteve S Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:20 am\nI?ve seen the WalMart documentary, which doesn?t really apply here because last I heard WalMart average hourly employee makes about $9-10/hour. My whole point is this:\nNobody is putting a gun to your head and making you put on that McDonalds hat for 40 hours a week serving fries and burgers. At some point in a person?s life, they have to make a conscious decision to either further their career, or stay stagnant (and then complain about it). As this website constantly points out, the BEST way to live below your means is to increase your means. Ramen can only get so cheap. Free washer/dryers from Craigslist will eventually break. Your salary is something that you have personal control over. Isn?t that an empowering feeling?!\nIf you apply yourself and obtain however much of an education you think you need, someday you can have a job that pays well and allows you to sit and read Personal Finance blogs every morning! WHEEEEEE!\nNicole Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:31 am\nI agree and disagree with the posters. I agree that it takes very little to get past making minimum wage for the average person with a little ?common sense?. Unfortunately, common sense isn?t common and many people don?t have the basic skills to do better. We take for granted so much of what our parents/environment taught us. I live in Philly and I mentor a young woman who comes from the ghetto. Her sister is 24 and works a 15 hr./week job at Macy?s making minimum wage. Her IQ is so low she can barely handle that. The young woman I mentor works a $10/hr job and is going to be ok. But truly it has been as a result of me DRILLING into her the basics of customer service, appearance at work, grammar, etc. I don?t think that this is the gov?ts responsibility but I do think it is our responsibility as individuals to help those around us that have not been properly armed for the real world by parents and schools.\nXias Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:34 am\nInteresting, $11,500 annually eh? I think I could swing that..of course I don?t have kids or an expensive mortgage. I think this would be impossible to raise a family on (even if your spouse worked as well). In my area (near Philadelphia) minimum wage jobs are a rarety.\nI wonder where most minimum wage earners are by region?\nEd Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 7:48 am\nThe IRS says you have to pay taxes on any income, that includes cash tips. If you do not report it because it can?t be ?tracked? then lets call it what it is, dishonesty, cheating on taxes, lack of moral compass, whatever.\nMany people do it, but lets not rationalize it because my friends, cousins, brothers, sisters, aunt, uncles, etc., don?t feel bad about it.\nCompounding Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:01 am\nXias,\nThat is an interesting point. If someone is only making $11.5K a year, it would be difficult to raise a family. I would think that the novel approach would be to not have kids if you can?t support them, or to increase your earnings.\nI have had those jobs before, and there were things that could be done, even then. In fast food, and many other restaurant jobs, turnover is high. Ask to be promoted if you don?t plan on getting out of that line of work. Heck, I was a shift manager for a year when I graduated from high school early, at 17. If you don?t have enough motivation to find a different line of work, the least you could do is apply yourself and move up the meager ladder within it.\nHeck, if you worked at McDonald?s, and became a manager, they have programs where they can work with you to get your own franchise, which could actually lead into becoming quite well off.\nOpportunity exists? others should not be punished because some people just won?t wake up.\nWesley Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:02 am\nHa! I?m with Steve S?that?s just funny stuff. I worked a min wage job in high school (and through a portion of college). If you?re not getting tips, why do it? I had a really fun job delivering steaks, and made some decent money in hindsight.\nI have a tough time feeling sorry for someone flipping burgers for min wage. I see ?help wanted? signs all over the place. Unless you have a harsh criminal record, there are jobs out there.\nJenn Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:14 am\nHere in West Virginia the most prevalent industry is the service industry (i.e. retail, food, etc.). However, the overall economy is poor. (Despite the service industry being prevalent, it is no where near as large as in other states. Because there simply isn?t enough money in the state to support it.)\nPeople who make minimum wage do not get to earn above it. When I worked in Robinson, PA I easily made $8/hour. But down here, without the good economy and competition, people are paid the normal $5 and change per hour.\nJenn Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:23 am\nRe: Steve\nThere are people who do as you suggest: go above and beyond, ask for raises, etc. I?ve been one of those people. But you have to understand that the retail/food service industries see minimum-wage workers as disposable items. They?re just a means to an end, if you will. And the turn over is so great, that they know they can easily replace you with someone else if you leave.\nRaises are especially hard to come by. You have to be promoted (such as into management) in order to obtain one. Also, companies like to cut your hours. I worked at Old Navy after moving to WV. Having been a manager in PA, I worked harder than most other associates. But they cut my hours, and those of other associates who had been there for a long while, without reason and gave them to newcomers.\nAlso, it?s becoming more frequent for retail companies to put associates on-call. With Old Navy, I had certain days and times where I *might* work. I had to call in 2 hours ahead of time and see whether they needed me or not. (And I was an associate making $5! On call should only be for professionals.)\nAs a former manager, trust me. It all comes down to almighty dollar. And even when you?re a hard worker like me, it?s difficult to keep working hard for companies that clearly don?t care about the employee. You?re just disposable labor?nothing more.\nNorman Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:33 am\nAmanda in #1\n?Also, minimum wage for working where tips are an expected part of your income is lower than minimum wage elsewhere.?\nNot in Oregon. It?s the higher state min. wage (7.80) + tips.\nIn other states with tip credit, the Fed law says if you are earning less than the min. wage and your tips don?t bring you up to it, then the employer is on the hook to make up the difference.\nFMF Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 8:34 am\nJ.D. ?\nI?m waiting for the storm that is about to come.\nMary Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 9:41 am\nI worked a minimum wage job (+ minimal bar tips) this summer while finishing my degree - and while it was easy to get mimimum wage work, hardly any of the summer jobs available in my city paid any more.\nThe difference being, though, that I?m a Scot, and the minimum wage here for over 22s is now �5.52/hour, which works out at a more than respectable $11.25/hour for you.\nMatt Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 9:52 am\nI make just above minimum wage. My hourly wage works out to just below $7/hour, I get paid salary but I work 80 hours a week or more. I work at one of the best restaurants in the country and we make about as much as the average McDonald?s employee and I don?t get any benefits.\nKind of makes me wonder why I paid all that money for the Bachelor?s degree in Culinary Arts. But I?m not complaining, right now. I CHOSE this job. For now I like it but I?ll probably only last another year until I get a job that pays more for less hours of work.\nnolandda Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 9:55 am\nI worked in a local greasy-spoon diner when I was young. We had to fill out a form at the end of the shift declaring how much we made in tips. The boss didn?t care what we put so long as our base pay plus tips exceeded 4.25 USD/hour (otherwise he had to make up the difference).\nI can agree with others that this system was abused. However, unlike some of them, I have a hard time working up a great deal of moral indignation at the lowest wage earners in our society dodging a few taxes. Compared to the tax dodging of our richest citizens it is a drop in the bucket, and a good argument can be made that the poor need the money more.\n3% of the workforce doesn?t sound too bad. Even if the entire population worked (it doesn?t) that would be:\n300,000,000 people * 3% = 9,000,000 people at minimum wage. Which sounds bad until you see that there are more than 42,000,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 24.\nBibliography:\nHistorical Minimum Wages [pdf]\nPopulation by Age Group\nSam Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 10:04 am\nA great book to read on this topic is Nickeled and Dimed in which a journalist goes undercover to work a variety of low paying wages to see if she can support herself.\nI think the % of folks making min. wage is pretty small these days (many states now have min. wages that are above the fed. min. wage) but there are still a big chunk of folks who make more than min. wage but are still below the poverty level while working full time. It seems to me, in my humble opinion, that someone working a full time job ought to make enough to be above the poverty line.\nSam Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 10:11 am\nOne other interesting factoid from this post that I wanted to comment on. Companies that have factories in the AS islands are able to put a made in the USA tag on goods but the AS islands pays well below the min. wage for the USA. I pretty sure that there was recent (2007) legislation that changed or is changing that, but doesn?t seem fair to me.\nBreaking the Shackles: How to Escape from Minimum Wage ?

Before judging everyone in this state and slapping them with the label of ?lazy? or ?unmotivated,? consider the possibility that many of them may suffer from chronic physical or mental health conditions that have gone untreated or possibly even undiagnosed, and that these conditions are very real and unmovable roadblocks, preventing them from changing their lives for the better.\nSteve Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 12:18 pm\nMizD:\nThat is why you need the free market to determine wages, benefits, and so on. All the government wants to do is place you in a group. Guy A is a ?poor black man? so he gets welfare and doesn?t pay taxes, Guy B is a ?rich while capitalistic pig? so he gets extra taxes?by placing people in groups we aren?t taking into account their individual situations. By making the group ?minimum wage earners? and targeting them for a select set of benefits, you can?t weed out the lazy ones from the those who have experienced real catastrophe. My company employs a couple of physically disabled people who wouldn?t have been able to get jobs many other places. But they have done so out of the goodness of their own hearts, not by government mandate, which is the way it should be.\nAnd Ed: I wasn?t suggesting not reporting tips is not criminal activity, because it is. I was merely pointing out that that is the state of mind of many restaurant personnel out there.\nAnd let?s all not forget the fact that union wages are tied to the minimum wage, so raising the minimum wage is really a political move to benefit much more than the ~3% who do earn that (but that?s a story for a different forum).\nNathan Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 3:41 pm\nUnless I am reading something incorrectly, the Department of Labor page you link to indicates that 2.2% of hourly workers make minimum wage or less, not 2.9% as you have posted. The 1.4% for people over 25 years is the same.\nSomething to consider: 1.4% of the population has an IQ of 67 or less. Obviously, IQ is not a good indicator for someone?s potential to make money, but being that low (67 is over 2 standard deviations from the mean) can make it difficult to compete with other employees.\nJ.D. Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 4:12 pm\nUnless I am reading something incorrectly, the Department of Labor page you link to indicates that 2.2% of hourly workers make minimum wage or less, not 2.9% as you have posted\nNathan, the truth is that page makes my head hurt. And I like statistics. It?s true that the DoL prose cites a 2.2% figure, but if you look at the actual tables, the number is 2.9%. I suspect there?s some data clipping going on someplace. (In other words, there are some ?cohorts? that aren?t included in the 2.2% number.)\nAlso, by definition, isn?t a 67 IQ 3.3 standard deviations from the mean?\nTim Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 5:16 pm\nif you get audited, it looks awful funny when you have lots of stuff that does not equal what you reported in tips. yes, people like to work in service industry that deals with cash, because they can pocket much of cash without reporting even though they are supposed to report. many people choose these jobs, because they can make a lot of cash under the table.\nfolks with illnesses and disabilities grave enough to limit job opportunities is an insignificant percentage. This does not mean you are insignificant, it just means that, yes, we are generalizing, but in general many people stay at minimum wages because they don?t want to take the risk or are too lazy to improve their situation. they would rather feel they are entitled to something rather than doing something about it.\nNathan Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 5:28 pm\nI see 2.2 on the first row, tenth column of tables 1-9.\nThe IQ normal distribution has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, so 67 would be (100-67)/15 = 2.2 standard deviations from the mean.\nJ.D. Says:\nOctober 9th, 2007 at 5:39 pm\n@Nathan\nAh, I was laboring under a misapprenension regarding IQs. I thought that the scale had a standard deviation of 10. There goes a decade-old misconception.\nI went back through the tables, and you?re absolutely correct. Minimum wage workers represent 2.2% of hourly workers. For the life of me, I can?t see what made me change the number to 2.9%. I know that it happened late last night in final editing, so I?ll use that as a lame excuse.\nThanks for setting me straight on my statistics!\nThe Simple Dollar � The Simple Dollar Morning Roundup: Productive Edition Says:\nOctober 10th, 2007 at 6:31 am\n[?] Who Earns Minimum Wage?

As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Paul tirelessly works for limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies. He is known among his congressional colleagues and his constituents for his consistent voting record. Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution.\nLife and Liberty\nThe right of an innocent, unborn child to life is at the heart of the American ideals of liberty. My professional and legislative record demonstrates my strong commitment to this pro-life principle.\nIn 40 years of medical practice, I never once considered performing an abortion, nor did I ever find abortion necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman.\nIn Congress, I have authored legislation that seeks to define life as beginning at conception, HR 1094.\nI am also the prime sponsor of HR 300, which would negate the effect of Roe v Wade by removing the ability of federal courts to interfere with state legislation to protect life. This is a practical, direct approach to ending federal court tyranny which threatens our constitutional republic and has caused the deaths of 45 million of the unborn.\nI have also authored HR 1095, which prevents federal funds to be used for so-called ?population control.?\nMany talk about being pro-life.

36	On Thursday the Times reported that the Bush administration had conspired to circumvent several laws?domestic and international?and provide their henchmen with the legal cover to perpetuate barbaric interrogation techniques. The rest of the mainstream media hardly picked up on the story, and average Americans went about their lives. Where was the outrage?

Bud."\nThe plants, collectively worth nearly seven billion dollars each year, account for a whopping six percent of this province's power consumption.\nThe labor-intensive crop is an energy sponge thanks in large part to the 1,000 watt halogen lights, fans, irrigation pumps and other equipment needed for their cultivation. As a result, the pot growers' energy bills are about three times that of the average consumer.\nThose energy consumption patterns drew the notice of authorities, who have benefitted from a 2006 law allowing BC Hydro, the area's main power company, to share its residential power consumption records with local officials.\nArmed with a list of likely offenders, a team of inspectors -- including a firefighter, an electrician, an admistrative employee and two policmen -- is dispatched to each suspect residence.\n"We inspect between 70 and 80 homes a month, said Len Garis, head of firefighters in Surrey, a suburb of Vancouver.\nInspectors are looking to verify, first and foremost, that the power lines' insulation coating is in good condition and that the circuit breakers are working properly.\nAbout 90 percent of the time, this is not the case: Inspections often reveal serious problems in the electrical connections as a result of the high demands placed on them. According to the city, pot growers' homes have a 24 times greater chance than the average home of catching fire and burning down.\nIn the event of electrical problems, the current to the home is cut and cannot be reestablished until repairs are made.\nThe inspection team rarely sees the real target of the operation -- the pot plants -- because authorities are obliged by law to notify residents at least 48 hours prior to an inspection. The early tip usually gives the home pot grower more that adequate time to stow away his illicit crop.\n"It's not about a criminal operation, but simply a means of insuring security for the people," said Joel Giebelhaus, an aide to Surrey's mayor.\nSince the beginning of inspections in 2006, the number of home cannabis plantations has dropped by 65 percent in Surrey and 14 other towns in the province participating in the power-cutoff approach to the war on drugs.\n"I'm afraid of these inspections," one local marijuana farmer told AFP, under condition of anonymity, acknowledging that without power, it would be impossible to operate the powerful lights he has going 18 hours a day to keep his pot plants growing.\nIt is not a one-sided battle however.\nMarc Emery, who heads the "BC Marijuana Party," a small political group pushing for the legalization of pot, insisted that the province's offensive will prove futile, as growers figure out new methods to grow their crops without overtaxing the power infrastructure.\nFor example, one company selling hydroponic crop equipment also stocks a lamp that consumes 80 percent less energy than the traditional grow lamps.\nIn a counter-punch however, officials in some localities decided in late September to impose tighter restrictions on the companies selling hydroponic growing equipment.\nCopyright AFP 2007, AFP stories and photos shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium\nClick here to buy text ads on Breitbart\nLATEST VIDEO\nTOP NEWS\nMOST E-MAILED\n?\nSexy Glenn?

A man who spent a dozen years in prison for a rape he didn't commit was freed Tuesday, the third inmate to be released because of problems with the Houston Police Department's crime lab.\nWearing dark clothes and carrying a red mesh gym bag and a paper sack containing his belongings, Ronald Taylor greeted his family with warm embraces outside the Harris County Jail.\n"It hasn't really sunk in. I'm just glad to see my family," he said.\nHis plans included eating shrimp, a delicacy he missed in prison, and moving to Atlanta to marry Jeannette Brown, the fiancee who has waited for him since the mid-1990s.\nBut his first stop was City Hall, where Taylor, 47, urged the City Council to prevent other innocent prisoners from rotting behind bars.\n"They don't have the finances, they don't have nobody to help them," he said. "I think something needs to be done about that."\nHouston officials have been struggling to fix the crime lab for years. An independent audit in 2002 raised concerns about DNA analysis procedures. In June, a former U.S. Justice Department inspector hired by the city cited hundreds of "serious and pervasive" flaws in forensic cases handled by the lab.\nTaylor was convicted of rape in 1995 and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The victim picked him out of a lineup but acknowledged she only caught a glimpse of her attacker's face.\nDuring his trial, a crime lab analyst testified that no body fluids were found on the victim's bedsheet. This summer, the Innocence Project paid to have a New Orleans lab retest the bedsheet. Semen that lab found matched the DNA of a man already in prison.\nHarris County District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal apologized to Taylor in court Tuesday, and several council members echoed his regret.\nTaylor and his mother, Dorothy Henderson, a food-services supervisor at the Walker County Jail, said they didn't blame the criminal justice system for his imprisonment.\n"We've just been praying and I just had faith and I knew, I knew within my heart that one day he would get out," Henderson said.\nAssociated Press writer Juan A.

Bush, Democrats voted on Wednesday to bolster civil liberties safeguards in his anti-terrorism spying program and refused to shield phone companies from pending lawsuits.\nADVERTISEMENT\n');\nJust hours after Bush warned Democrats they would be rolling back efforts to protect the United States, the House of Representatives Judiciary and Intelligence committees approved legislation to ensure congressional and court oversight of the surveillance of suspected enemy targets.\nThe party-line votes by the two panels were 20-14 and 12-7, respectively.\nThe full House is to consider the bill next week. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to begin work on its version next Thursday.\nHouse Democrats rejected a bid by Bush's fellow Republicans to provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that cooperated in the president's warrantless spying program secretly begun shortly after the September 11 attacks.\nBush insisted the new bill "must grant liability protection to companies who are facing multibillion dollar lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend our nation."\nDemocratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan replied: "The president's remarks today raise further questions about how the administration might have pressured or induced telecommunications companies to participate."\nHouse Democrats say they will not consider retroactive immunity unless the White House hands over records of detailing what the companies did. The House bill would protect the firms from future lawsuits, but not from pending ones.\nIt also would revise and replace a temporary surveillance measure, the Protect America Act, that Bush pushed through the Democrat-led Congress in August amid warnings that the United States faced new threats.\nThat earlier measure expanded the federal warrantless surveillance authority and closed what the administration said was a dangerous legal gap.\nThe new House bill would require the administration to obtain one-year "blanket warrants" from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor telephone calls or e-mails of suspected terrorists when they involve an American citizen.\nIt would not require individual warrants to listen in on Americans communicating with suspected terrorists, unless the U.S. citizen is also a specific target of the surveillance. No warrant would be needed to monitor foreign suspects speaking to each other overseas.\n"The legislation before us today seeks to once again strike the appropriate balance between needed government authority and our precious rights and liberties," said House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat.\nBush warned the new measure "would take us backward."\n"The Protect America Act is a vital tool in stopping the terrorists, and it would be a grave mistake for Congress to weaken this tool," he said.\nCritics say the warrantless surveillance program begun after the September 11 attacks was unlawful. The White House maintains Bush acted within his authority.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group, sued telephone giant AT&T Inc last year and accused it of illegally allowing the government to monitor phone calls and e-mails.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney General Ken Wainstein said the administration is also concerned about restrictions the bill would impose on the type of intelligence that could be collected, and a provision that would have the surveillance authority expire in 2009, the year Bush leaves office.\nBush wants the Protect America Act, set to expire in February, made permanent.\nEmail Story\nIM Story\nPrintable View\nRECOMMEND THIS STORY\nRecommend It: Not at All Somewhat Moderately Highly Very Highly\nAverage (Not Rated)\n� Recommended Stories\nFull Coverage: Terrorism\nOff the Wires\nBush warns Congress not to weaken eavesdrop powers AFP, 34 minutes ago\nDems muscle through surveillance bill AP, 35 minutes ago\nFeature Articles\nU.S. tries rehab for religious extremists The Christian Science Monitor via Yahoo!

Customers also purchased iPods, digital cameras and prepared food.\n``The thing that Costco has going for them is that they tend to get a little bit more upscale customers,'' Rachel Wakefield, who helps manage $1.2 billion for Coldstream Capital Management, including Costco shares, said Oct. 1. We wonder if people aren't switching to Costco in an attempt to save a little money? Nah. It's just that (according to this photo we found on Flickr), they sell delicious Mexican Coca-Cola by the case.

I haven't had a chance to try Coke though.\nAs for Costco, I love shopping there. Everything is usually priced fairly according to competition, the stores are clean and the employees are friendly.\nBY STRUM40 AT 02:03 PM\nI guess people like shopping at stores that actually pay their employees more than minimum wage.\nBY JUSTAGUY2 AT 02:11 PM\nCostco's demographic is, in general, higher income than some other chains (esp. Walmart), so they're less affected by things like higher gas prices.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 02:15 PM\nPersonally, I don't really care what employees make.\nI want my stuff to be good quality at a good price. I want to pay a fair price and shop in a clean and organized store.\nEmployee wages are a personal matter between the employer and the employee. No one forces the employee to work at any store - employment is always up to the prospective employee. I know what I'm worth, and my number is realistic. A cashier is not worth $12 an hour, no matter how nice they are.\nI find it hilarious that people bemoan Walmart all the time about their wages. Walmart consistently pays more than minimum wage. Sure, they've have their issues and they are being taken to task about it (they will eventually pay). The notion that Walmart 'owes' their employees a living wage is ridiculous. Walmart only owes the employee what they agree to pay them. Don't like it? Work elsewhere. OR get another job.\nI'd LOVE to make $350,000 a year, but I don't hold a grudge against my employer because they don't pay me as much.\nI find it funny that whenever a thread gets started involving waiters (please don't start one again...), people are HAPPY to point out that wages are an employee/employer issue. When waiters claim to be upset about bad tippers, people call them whiners. When a Walmart stocker complains about not being able to feed their family, people call Walmart evil.\nI believe there are words to describe that:\nduplicitous and hypocritical come to mind.\nCostco rocks because they offer me great deals on stuff I like to buy. They keep their stores clean and organized, and have large parking lots.\nBY URICMU AT 02:24 PM\nCoke made with sugar (or cane sugar) rather than High-Fructose corn syrup actually tastes better. You can find it in the spring in many locations as "kosher coke"\nIt shows you how evil corporations are if sugar is too expensive for them in a drink that consists primarily of sugar.\nBY INSTIGATOR AT 02:27 PM\nI'm a Costco fan, too, but I'm not so sure about the take that Costco's members occupy higher rungs on the socio-economic ladder than Wal-Mart's customers. The liquor store at my neighborhood Costco keeps the Petron behind the counter because of "loss" issues. Or maybe Costco just attracts a more discerning class of shoplifter.\nBY SARUSA AT 02:27 PM\nI started shopping at Costco when Ralphs/Albertsons etc. had their big stupid grocery strike and nearly cried when I saw how much money I'd been wasting by shopping at grocery stores. You can get good stuff at Costco for half to a quarter the price for the exact same product. Assuming you can consume it all before it goes bad of course. The employees seem to be fairly efficient and courteous enough and it's not filthy like a Walmart or the Target near me.\nThe only two downsides to Costco - their stock is so variable depending on what you can get deals on. I can get addicted to a cereal or ice cream or whatever, then one day it's just gone. Forever. The worst bit is that they're so insanely busy. You just can't go near it on weekends due to all the families who drive carts as badly as they drive their SUVs. But weekday nights? Awesome.\nSo yeah, I make plenty of money but I buy everything I can at Costco.\nBY PYLOFF AT 02:28 PM\n@fej Wow you are all over the place, try to stick with a cogent point. Stating you don't care what people make and then ranting they aren't worth more than $12...\nBY COOLTRI AT 02:36 PM\nI'm at Costco bi-weekly for basic. A 2pack of milk, bread, coffee creamer,and eggs. buying these there are way cheaper that Buying one of each at Safeway. In season i can get a heavy bunch of bananas for $.99 while its .99 a pound at the other stores.\nAlso the tend not to sell crap that no one wants to buy. just to fill the shelves.\nBY ADAMONDI AT 02:37 PM\nCostco is doing well because it is a company that believes in not screwing over the people with whom it does business. They pay their employees well. They treat their customers well. They have excellent customer service and extremely fair return/exchange policies. They treat their suppliers well.\nAmazing how this is such a novelty in the modern business world. However, Costco is essentially just doing good business instead of trying to squeeze everyone for every last cent.\nBY N1CKEL5 AT 02:46 PM\n@pyloff: It made sense to me.\nBY IMAGINARY_FRIEND AT 02:46 PM\nCostco does indeed rock. They have an awesome selection of produce nearly year round and their organic foods are pretty good too. Anything I can buy at Costco, I do buy there ... even if the price is slightly higher (rare, but it happens) because, yes, I do care that a company pays it's employees a living wage and tries to be a good corporate citizen. The Walmart way of doing business is ruining this country; those who can't see that are deluding themselves.\nBY LIQUISOFT AT 02:52 PM\nPure cane sugar coke? I thought they shoved High Fructose Corn Syrup into everything, everywhere.\nBY CINEMABEE AT 02:58 PM\nI saw that Coke at Costco a while back as well. The sugar wasn't what interested me -- I was excited to see it was in GLASS! I love pop in a glass bottle. The taste is fabulous, and the experience of it is so much more fun and nostalgic. If it had been Pepsi, I'd have gotten it in an instant. Man, I wish I could find that somewhere. I miss it! Does anyone know if Pepsi in glass is available anywhere?\nBY MYRON AT 03:07 PM\n@fejjnagaf:\n"Personally, I don't really care what employees make."\nFine. Some people do care and vote with their wallets.\nBY POWERJHB AT 03:07 PM\nFor pure cane sugar Coke you could also buy the Kosher for Passover version that Coke makes every year around March or April. Stock up as they limit the supply.\nBY DRGIRLFRIEND AT 03:07 PM\nWhole Foods brand cola is also made with cane sugar, IIRC. Just another alternative if you can't find Mexican Coke and have access to a Whole Foods.\nBY HOLLERHITHER AT 03:14 PM\n@fejjnagaf:\nIsn't it part of the story that there are fewer "elsewheres" to work these days? There's Wal-Mart...and Wal-Mart.\n(Wouldn't we all like to make $350K. I don't see how that's the issue at hand when you're talking about minimum wage -- or less when you factor in lack of insurance coverage.)\nRegardless, Costco is relatively employee-friendly, and, out of all of the big box stores, one that I feel okay about supporting from time to time.\nBY GRANTGANNON AT 03:29 PM\nI love CostCo and use it for major purchases. Unfortunately the nearest one to me is 17 miles away. Meanwhile I have Sam's Club 5 miles on either side of my apartment.\nBY FUZZ AT 03:31 PM\n@liquisoft:\nNope, just in the States. You can thank your government subsidizing the corn industry with your tax dollars for that one. Up here in Canada our Coke is made with sugar, and it actually tastes good.I don't know how you can even drink that HFCS stuff. Nasty.\nBY STARFURY AT 03:36 PM\nMy family shops at Costco 2-3 times a month. Most of our purchases are food. Costco has the lowest prices on eggs, cheese, and their meat quality is excellent. We buy 99% of our hamburger there and also most of our pork.\nIt is very easy to drop $250 on a trip there for a major shopping run.\nPlus: Where else can you get a hot dog and coke for $1.50?\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 03:48 PM\n@hollerhither:\nNo offense intended, I'm not buying what you are selling.\nWhen there are no other jobs, you move to find the new one.\nThat's been a part of American culture since it's inception. People go where the jobs are.\nI remember asking my parents why my grandparents came to Chicago when they immigrated here. It's cold here 3/4 of the year. The answer? This is where the jobs were.\nNow, I realize that times can be tough, but this concept of people being stubborn and staying in a town with few jobs seems a little silly.\nMy friend was a swim coach in the chicago area. To do that full time in Chicago is almost impossible. He had to teach private lessons and run a pool at the Y to make ends meet. A few years back, he moved to California where swim coaching is a full time job, and the reward is greater.\nWalmart isn't the only big company to displace small businesses. Walgreens and CVS did it too. Do you have a local pharmacist? Better question - do you use him or do you go to a big box pharmacy?\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 03:49 PM\n@pyloff:\nSorry.\nCostco good.\nBetter?\n:-)\nBY BEERAD AT 03:56 PM\n@fejjnagaf: I don't know where you live, but I hope you aren't anywhere near my community. I like fair prices and nice stores too (<3 Costco!), but I also like to support an economically sustainable system that respects its employees. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like my neighbors to be surly and resentful because they're stuck in crappy jobs.\nI find it absurd and annoying when people say things like "the notion that [any company] owes their employees a living wage is ridiculous." Yes, ridiculous that as a society we set limits on just how far businesses can exploit their workers, isn't it? What kind of crazy world would it be if everyone was allowed to earn enough money to survive, huh? Companies exist because we, as society, allow them to exist. I, for one, expect a little something in return, and is "not oppressing your employees" really too much to ask?\nBY BREALS AT 03:57 PM\nYes, I have a case of Costco Mexican Coke in my fridge right now.\nBY RAZZLER AT 04:02 PM\n@fejjnagaf:\nYou still haven't made a cogent argument for why a cashier shouldn't be paid $12 an hour. A well-compensated worker is less likely to steal from the store, will stay at the job longer and will work harder because the job is worth it.\nCostco is posting gains, treats both customers and employees well, and still has unbeatable prices. What exactly do you think they are doing wrong?\nBY HOLLERHITHER AT 04:05 PM\n@fejjnagaf:\nActually, I used local pharmacies for years. There aren't any, anymore. I also go to big box grocery stores when necessary. Those are choices of convenience -- hours, location -- but I do spend a considerable amount of time and dollars supporting local businesses in my area (that means avoiding the mall, for example). But there is nothing I need at Wal Mart that I can't find elsewhere.\nHowever, I don't begrudge those in remote communities the option of shopping at Wal Mart vs. driving several hours for supplies.\nI could go on about why/how/when I vote with my dollars, and talk about the impracticalities of moving locations for low-paying work and how the demise of manufacturing factors into the lack of options for limited-skilled workers :) but it seems unlikely we're going to come to agreement on this one. Cheers!\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 04:13 PM\n@Beerad:\nI live in Chicago.\nI make a great wage, having worked hard to attend college and worked harder to do well where I work.\nThere is nothing inherently disrespectful about paying your employees in excess of $8 an hour (walmarts average hourly wage is higher than that) to do what amounts to menial tasks. If you work at a job that can be easily done by a 16 year old high school student with the attention span of a small feral cat, then don't expect a high wage.\nThis is America. In America, you are compensated for your work.\nSimple. A business is not 'exploiting their workers' by paying them in excess of minimum wage. To make that claim is intellectually dishonest. Have you ever worked in retail? Most of your day is spent standing around or fixing the facing of shelved items. This is not neurosurgery.\nAnd I'd like an explanation of how you consider paying a stock boy at Walmart $8.50 an hour is 'oppressing' or 'exploiting' employees.\nIt's called work. If you agree to the wage, and that wage is above the legal minimum, then it's on you, not the company.\nBY VANDON AT 04:18 PM\n@Myron: "Personally, I don't really care what employees make."\nFine. Some people do care and vote with their wallets.\nFYI, I'm starting a grocery store and the starting wage for all employees $250K a year. I'm the only employee and milk is $250,000 a gallon....I only have to sell one.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 04:22 PM\n@Razzler:\nThat's easy.\nThe answer to your query is: because that is more than the market dictates.\nIf they can fill those same positions at $8-9 an hour, they can save huge money and get the same productivity.\nLet's do the math, using a standard 40 hour work week.\n40x9=360\nmost companies pay bi-weekly, which works out to a gross of $720. Yearly, that ends up being $18,720.\n40x12=480. bi-weekly = 960. yearly $24,960. By paying $9 and hour instead of $12, they save $6240 a year on labor costs. How many thousands of walmart employees are cashiers? 1000? 4000? Let's just SAY its only 1000. That means the company saves over $6 million by paying them what the market commands.\nMy whole point isn't that Costco is doing something wrong. My point is that they are doing pretty much the same thing employee wise that Walmart does. Granted, they have better practices, but wage wise things are similar.\nAnd I find it laughable that you think it is okay to steal if you get paid less than you want.\nMoral relativism anyone?\nSimply put, you shouldn't steal because it is wrong to steal, not because of a wage.\nWalmart offers job opportunities to people. Those that do their jobs well get promotions. I know for a fact that many of their store managers started out as stockers, cashiers, and other low rung jobs.\nCostco is great. I love them. They shouldn't change. I was making more of a general comparison to the walmart scenarios because people seem to think that walmart pays their people less than other stores, which is just not factual.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 04:24 PM\n@hollerhither:\nDon't get me wrong, I support local business whenever possible as well.\nLike you, there are other factors that alter that behavior. And it is okay.\nIf I want something that the local guy is charging 30% more than walmart, you can bet I'm in line at walmart thinking about how much I hate them.\nWe agree more than we disagree, methinks....\nBY MISSJ AT 04:29 PM\n@fejjnagaf: I actually have to agree with you on that one, though I'm thinking of bookstores. Mom and Pop places don't tend to overcharge, but when B&N has it for 40% off, paying full price just doesn't seem so economic.\nBY BEERAD AT 04:38 PM\n@fejjnagaf: I think you may have misconstrued what I wrote -- I was simply referring to your comment that businesses shouldn't have to pay employees a living wage. As you recognize, we have a federally mandated minimum wage. It's there for a reason. I never claimed that it was exploitative to pay employees more than the minimum wage (although there's plenty of argument that the minimum should be raise), merely that the position that "wages are a personal matter between the employer and the employee" is untenable.\nBY CAPTAINSEMANTICS AT 04:40 PM\nMy partner and I spend $300 a month at Costco, buying various groceries/fruit/bread/whatever. The price is right, the people are nice, and heck, I get free samples. Although, on Mondays around Noon the samples suck. We got the executive membership, which costs an extra $50, but they give you 2% of your purchases (well, most of them) at the end of the year. It makes perfect sense for our budget. $3600/yr X 2% = $72, making an extra $22. Not much, but it all adds up.\nBY CSDIEGO AT 04:47 PM\n@fejjnagaf: OK, so you worked hard enough in college to be in a position to sneer at people making $8/hour. I worked hard enough in college to have the luxury of living in an urban area where I can do all my shopping without ever having to set foot in Walmart; instead I have the privilege of living in walking distance of a grocery where the cashiers are paid considerably more than at Walmart, plus health and retirement benefits.\nAre low wages the way of the world? Sure. So are salmonella-tainted chicken, flammable Halloween costumes, and lead-painted toys. I don't mind not driving an SUV if I know my taxes are going toward better consumer product safety enforcement (not that they are, but that's another story). By the same token, I'd rather my grocery dollar go toward paying my share of a cashier's $15/hour than to allowing the Waltons to buy up half the state of Missouri and 3/4 of the US Congress, or whatever it is they're doing with the spare cash.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 05:08 PM\n@csdiego:\nNot sure where you get off saying I 'sneer' at $8 an hour cashiers. I am just being realistic, and honest.\nI always treat them with respect and kindness.\nI don't frequent wal-mart either and completely prefer buying local - like you, I live in a huge city. But I would be willing to wager that you would be hard pressed to find a cashier getting paid more locally than you would find working at walmart.\nAnd, for the record, there is no cashier job in the US that pays $15 an hour. It just doesn't exist.\nSo let's be realistic here for a minute - Starbucks starting pay around where I live is in the area of $9 an hour. Starting wages for a cashier at the walmart on the south side of Chicago is between 8 and 9 dollars. The guy at starbucks has to learn to make the coffee, operate the espresso machine, clean, merchandise product, keep up the standards on their beans, count their drawers properly and use their POS system etc. A walmart cashier has to learn to use their POS and how to count out their drawer. They never learn how to do anything, really. They don't make anything for consumption. So why is it that the starbucks employees aren't deserving of your sympathy?\nBecause they don't work for walmart.\nlets call a spade a spade here. A cashier making $8-9 an hour is doing a remarkably easy job. It doesn't require a lot of skills and can be had by anyone who qualifies. So how is walmart taking advantage of the cashiers by not overpaying them to the tune of $15 an hour?\nThe median salary in chicago for a retail cashier is around $10 an hour. I have no problem whatsoever with walmart offering a new cashier $9 an hour and the cashier to be accepting it. I don't see it as an abuse and don't find that practice to be either illegal or improper.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 05:12 PM\n@Beerad:\nSo we agree?\nIf you accept the fact that I referred to them exceeding the federally mandated minimum wage, then we are essentially in agreement.\nWhat I meant by 'a living wage' is the ridiculous idea that walmart somehow should be required to pay their people more than the mandated minimum out of guilt or as a result of being a profitable and sustainable business.\nThey are under no such obligation.\nWould it be nice if they did? Of course.\nWould we all feel better about walmart if they paid their staffs double what they pay them now? Sure. But then we'd be paying more for their products, stores would close leaving thousands jobless, and their business would tank.\nIt's a balance.\nAll i am saying is that if you choose not to develop any marketable skill set, don't be outraged when your hourly wage caps out. A company doesn't owe you $15 an hour simply for existing. If they can fill their stores with employees for $9 an hour, more power to them to do so.\nBY HAWK07 AT 05:26 PM\nI wish I had Costco in my area.\nRight now, all we have is Sam's and they now have this new policy (or are enforcing an old one) that you must actually be holder of the card in order to buy. Personally, I use my dad's b/c when he goes, he's always with my mom.\nAnyways, they said I can't purchase stuff there without him present anymore. Yeah, well I know Sam's or Wally World's PR might read this, so I'll lay it out flat. The next time I go into Sam's, I'll be sure to buy more than I usually do. They pull this crap on me, they can have fun putting all the stuff back while I walk out the door and go to any of the four pure grocery chains in my area (even more if you include the super walmart's and super target's).\nAnother reason I love Costco is that the store's are always clean and has friendlier personnel. You can tell a Sam's club is owned by the Walton family because the store's are dirty as crap.\nBY CSDIEGO AT 05:30 PM\n@fejjnagaf: Your reply boils down to: "The free market dictates low wages for unskilled workers [by which I mean wages that are too low to allow the worker to afford the essentials]. They can suck it up or they can go to college." That in turn boils down to "let them eat cake". And the Starbucks vs. Walmart comparison is a red herring: low wages are low wages, regardless of who is paying them. If it doesn't bother you to know that the person who rang up your groceries is going home to a rat-infested bedroom, or to know that the chicken you just ate was teeming with salmonella until somebody cooked it to a crisp, then lucky you. I feel differently, which is why I'm not willing to let the free market have the last word in every area of the economy.\nI'm pretty sure the workers at my neighborhood store, part of a unionized chain, make more than $15/hour on average, although the cashiers may be on the low end of the scale.\nBut this is way off the original topic of Costco (for the record, I like Costco, although it's too far out of my way for me to shop there more than 4-6 times a year).\nBY BEERAD AT 05:33 PM\n@fejjnagaf: We agree insofar as we recognize that cashier is not a high-skills job, it's good for companies to pay above the minimum wage, and many people are hypocritical for bashing Wal-mart while turning a blind eye to similar practices of other employers.\nI vehemently disagree with your positions of "personally, I don't really care what employees make" and "the notion that Walmart 'owes' its employees a living wage is ridiculous" (although it seems that you're now interpreting "living wage" as "more than the minimum wage", which is better although open to the argument about whether minimum wage is really liveable.) And, on a technical note, I don't like whatever you're doing in your posts to leave that big blank gap at the end of them.\nBY MCONFOY AT 05:43 PM\n@fejjnagaf: Do hold a grudge against your employer if the pay the CEO millions and millions unrelated to performance because they stocked the board with their buddies? I guess you don't believe in the minimum wage either?\nBY INTERNAL AT 05:45 PM\nCostco is great fun to shop at, but 'wholesale' stores aren't that great for your pocketbook and contribute to over-consumption, IMHO, unless you are careful about what you buy and what you use.\nSure, you can buy 96 flippin' granola bars for $9, but why? Would you actually buy and eat that many at a regular grocery store? Not normally. 12 rolls of paper towels for $15? Great! But I bet you will use paper towels to clean up ever single mess you make and end up wasting a lot more then if you just got a couple at a time at Target.\nAlso, some of the prices are worse than a Grocery Store sale prices. Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts are regularly $2.35/lb at Costco, but at most grocery stores you can find them on sale for $1.79-1.99/lb. 32 Cokes for $7.90? I can find 24 can cases for $5 on sale.\nI could go on for a long while about Costco (I am kind of a junkie - I go way too much). Don't assume everything is a great deal at Costco. Shop and use wisely just like any other store.\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 05:47 PM\n@csdiego:\nYour assessment of what I said is close.\nLet's try it the right way:\nThe free market dictates the wages of unskilled workers. They can either get more than one job, stay at their current wage or they can go out and get some skills by attending college, going to a technical school, attending trainings, or getting a job where they train you on the job.\nThere is no red herring in the walmart/starbucks comparison. Same pay, same hours, different company. Yet you never hear about how starbucks employees deserve a 'living wage' or that starbucks is taking advantage of them.\nWhich is my point. The difference lies in the way our perceptions color our opinions.\nAnd if the workers in your area are part of a union, that means they pay every month for union dues, which robs them of part of that pay.\nBut it would absolutely shock me if they earned more than $10 or $11 an hour. Ask, then tell me what they tell you. $15 an hour is fantastic pay for unskilled labor.\nHere's a few jobs that usually earn less than $15 an hour to start, depending on the area of course:\njanitor\nmailroom clerk\nOffice manager\npayroll clerk\npharmacy technician\nreceptionist\nsecretary\nretail clerk\nsecurity guard\nHR assistant\nData Entry\ncomputer tech\nap clerk\nar clerk\ncustomer service rep\ntelemarketer\nSo, does a cashier at walmart deserve a better starting wage than any of these other jobs?\nBY FEJJNAGAF AT 05:51 PM\n@mconfoy:\nI do not hold a grudge against anyone for getting paid what they get paid.\nI think it's great if you can be a CEO and earn millions.\nIt doesn't affect me, so I just don't care.\nI'm not the jealous type.\nDo I believe in a minimum wage? Actually, yes. I do. I think it should be higher than it is.\nI think the minimum wage shoule be in the area of $8 an hour.\nIt's funny to me that people are now assigning me an evil personality...\nTruly. I think back to all the guys I knew who worked 2 jobs to support their families. They never complained, save to say they were tired when I asked how they were.\n@Beerad:\nI have no idea why huge gaps keep getting inserted when my comment is more than a few lines long...\nI promise I am not adding a whole bunch of spaces.\nI finish what I write, add a period and hit 'submit'.\nBY EYEBROWS MCGEE AT 05:52 PM\n@liquisoft: "I thought they shoved High Fructose Corn Syrup into everything, everywhere."\nShockingly, there are countries where HFCS isn't heavily subsidized by the government and cane sugar isn't tariffed into unaffordableness!\n@fejjnagaf: They may not be "oppressing" or "exploiting" employees, but it's economically foolish in the long term. Ford knew that you have to pay your employees enough for them to be able to afford your products. Ridiculously low minimum wages are part of the problem in our current economic spasms.\nAnd PS - not everyone can up and move across the country because the jobs are elsewhere. Even if they're free to do so, which not everyone is, moving still costs money.\nBY EYEBROWS MCGEE AT 05:54 PM\n@fejjnagaf: "Yet you never hear about how starbucks employees deserve a 'living wage' or that starbucks is taking advantage of them.\nWhich is my point. The difference lies in the way our perceptions color our opinions."\nIndeed it does. I have frequently heard people complain about the wages at Starbucks. But your perceptions are entirely blocking out all data that disagrees with your pre-existing opinions.\nBY CSDIEGO AT 05:56 PM\n@internal: You're right. I stopped buying cottage cheese at Costco because the huge tub kept going bad before I could finish it. And some of the treaty foods are way too easy to overconsume when you buy a ton of them (I'm looking at you, Stonyfield Farm Strawberry Smoothies), even if they're the kind of thing that will keep, in theory. Most of what I buy at Costco are canned goods and dry goods (oats, cereal, things like that), plus the heavenly and amazing Wyman's frozen blueberries.\nBY CSDIEGO AT 06:08 PM\n@fejjnagaf: No offense, but are you working for Walmart? Because a lot of what you are saying is, "Everybody else (Starbucks, the people who employ janitors and receptionists) is paying low wages. Why are you singling out Walmart?" Walmart is not the only low-wage employer out there, although it's true that they hurt the low-skilled workforce more in the small towns and rural areas where they are the only retailer, because they have more power there over the prevailing wage.\nI have to laugh at the way WM has now decided that they've tapped out the low end of the retail market (the poor are too poor to spend enough money in our stores! funny, that!) and now they're trying to go upscale. Good luck to them. Employees making bottom-of-the-barrel wages are never going to be motivated to create the kind of shopping environment that would attract upscale consumers, no matter how many songs and cheers you make them do to start the day.\nyou say:\nLogin with your username and password below.

49	The 6 Most Terrifying Foods in the World	CRACKED.com - The 6 Most Terrifying Foods in the World\nArticles\nVideos\nComics\nBut Seriously\nWebPicks\nForum\nComedy Clubs\nBlogs\nRSS\nAdvertise on CRACKED.com\nCRACKED.COM | ARTICLES | FEATURES\nThe 6 Most Terrifying Foods in the World\nBy Tim Cameron\nSend\nPrint\nHumans are like goats. We'll eat any damned thing. Just ask the people who make PowerBars.\nIn fact, you'll find foods in this world that don't even seem possible. Not just that they could exist, but that people would actually stick this stuff in their mouths without a gun to their head.\nWe've found six dishes that seemed to have sprung from Satan's own cookbook.\n#6.\nEscamoles\nFrom:\nMexico.\nWhat the hell is it?\nEscamoles are the eggs of the giant black Liometopum ant, which makes its home in the root systems of maguey and agave plants. Collecting the eggs is a uniquely unpleasant job, since the ants are highly venomous and have some kind of blood grudge against human orifices.\nThe eggs have the consistency of cottage cheese. The most popular way to eat them is in a taco with guacamole, while being fucking insane.\nWait, it gets worse ...\nEscamoles have a surprisingly pleasant taste: buttery and slightly nutty. This hugely increases the chances that, while in Mexico, you could eat them without realizing you are eating a taco full of fucking ant eggs.\nDanger of this turning up in America:\nWe?re not sure Taco Bell hasn?t snuck this shit into their food already. Just make sure you know what?s in that burrito. Ask at the counter if you have to. Also, watch those ads close because they?ll try to dress it up in some kind of friendly-sounding, pseudo-Mexican name.\n#5.\nCasu Marzu\nFrom:\nSardinia, Italy.\nWhat the hell is it?\nThis, dear reader, is a medium-sized lump of Sweet Fucking Christ. Casu Marzu is a sheep?s milk cheese that has been deliberately infested by a Piophila casei, the "cheese fly." The result is a maggot-ridden, weeping stink bomb in an advanced state of decomposition.\nIts translucent larvae are able to jump about 6 inches into the air, making this the only cheese that requires eye protection while eating. The taste is strong enough to burn the tongue, and the larvae themselves pass through the stomach undigested, sometimes surviving long enough to breed in the intestine, where they attempt to bore through the walls, causing vomiting and bloody diarrhea.\nWait, it gets worse ...\nThis cheese is a delicacy in Sardinia, where it is illegal. That?s right. It is illegal in the only place where people actually want to eat it. If this does not communicate a very clear message, perhaps the larvae will, as they leap desperately toward your face in an effort to escape the putrescent horror of the only home they have ever known. Even the cheese itself is ashamed; when prodded, it weeps an odorous liquid called lagrima, Sardinian for "tears."\nDanger of this turning up in America:\nThere is significant danger here, as we?re thinking the cheese companies have a lot of maggot stock in the back of their warehouse they?d like to get rid of. And, there may actually be a market for it. Self-loathing is a powerful force in this economy (see the diet section of your local supermarket) and there?s times you get low enough that, damn it, you feel like you deserve nothing better than infested cheese.\n#4.\nLutefisk\nFrom:\nNorway.\nWhat the hell is it?\nAhhh, Lutefisk. After the larvae-ridden cheese, it's a blessed relief to sample a clean, down-to-earth Scandinavian recipe.\nA little too clean.\nLutefisk is a traditional Norwegian dish featuring cod that has been steeped for many days in a solution of lye, until its flesh is caustic enough to dissolve silver cutlery.\nWait, it gets worse ...\nFor those of you who don't know, lye (potassium hydroxide/sodium hydroxide) is a powerful industrial chemical used for cleaning drains, killing plants, de-budding cow horns, powering batteries and manufacturing biodiesel. Contact with lye can cause chemical burns, permanent scarring, blindness or total deliciousness, depending on whether you pour it onto a herring or your own face. Or, so the lutefisk industry would have us believe.\nDanger of this turning up in America:\nIT?S ALREADY HERE! Shit!\nIt?s true, lutefisk is more popular in the United States than in Norway. What the hell are they doing with it? They?re not eating it are they? Is it because it?s a cheap alternative to colonic irrigation? Seriously, how do you advertise this stuff?\n#3.\nBaby Mice Wine\nFrom:\nKorea.\nWhat the hell is it?\nWhat better to wash down your gelatinous lumps of lye fish than a nice chilled cup of dead mice? What better indeed.\nBaby mice wine is a traditional Chinese and Korean ?health tonic,? which apparently tastes like raw gasoline. Little mice, eyes still closed, are plucked from the embrace of their loving mothers and stuffed (while still alive) into a bottle of rice wine. They are left to ferment while their parents wring their tiny mouse paws in despair, tears drooping sadly from the tips of their whiskers.\nWait, it gets worse ...\nDo you wince at the thought of swallowing a tequila worm? Imagine how you?d feel during a session on this bastard. Whoops, I swallowed a dead mouse! Whoops, there goes another one! Whoops, I just puked my entire body out of my nose!\nDanger of this turning up in America:\nWho are you going to find in America that?s OK with drinking dead fetus juice as a way to improve their own health? OK, other than lawyers.\n#2.\nPacha\nFrom:\nIraq.\nWhat the hell is it?\nOf all the dishes, this is the one most likely to be mistaken for a threatening message from the mob. It?s a sheep?s head. Boiled.\nWait, it gets worse ...\nPacha only reveals its terror gradually. Sure, maybe you can get around the fact that you?re eating face. But, the more you eat it, the more bone is revealed, until you give a final burp and set your cutlery down beside a grinning ivory skull. Its hollow eye sockets stare back at you with a look of grim damnation. "Burp while ye may," the sockets say, "for the same fate will happen to you--and all too soon."\nWe wonder why the Iraqis keep blowing themselves up? Wouldn?t you, if every evening meal was a festival of death?\nDanger of this turning up in America:\nNot looking like that, it won?t. But, you tell people that sheep head contains some kind of enzyme that boosts your metabolism and ...\n#1.\nBalut\nFrom:\nThe Philippines\nWhat the hell is it?\nBehold, for our journey of horror reaches its destination. Balut are duck eggs that have been incubated until the fetus is all feathery and beaky, and then boiled alive. The bones give the eggs a uniquely crunchy texture. They are enjoyed in Cambodia, Philippines and the fifth and seventh levels of hell. They are typically sold by street vendors at night, out of buckets of warm sand. You can spot the vendors because of their glowing red eyes, and the faint, otherworldly sound of children screaming.\nWait, it gets worse ...\n... Because you?re never going to look at an egg the same way. Tell yourself that every time you crack open an egg from now on you won?t be half expecting a leathery wad of bird to come flopping out into the skillet.\nYes, balut is upsetting on about a half-dozen levels. Sure, all meat eaters know on some level that the delicious chop on your plate used to belong to something cute and fluffy, which gambolled in the sun during the brief spring of its life.

As a person, you wish someone would feed you so good. You reach your prime, produce offspring maybe, and then BAM, you're dead, you don't even know what happened, painless, quick. You wish you could die so well as a person. Consider the alternative: you're some wild cow and maybe there's a drought or something and there's no food to eat and you're starving to death and all of a sudden a wolf or coyote or some shit comes along and fucking eats you alive.

50	Russian viagra spammer murdered	Russian Viagra and Penis Enlargement Spammer Murdered - Alex Loonov's Blog\nalex loonov's blog / miscellaneous ramblings\nRussian Viagra and Penis Enlargement Spammer Murdered\nPosted on October 11th, 2007 by admin and filed under Uncategorized.\nWow, just saw this on TV, so I decided to translate this story into English so my readers will be first to learn this. Sorry for mistakes in my English, I'm doing this in a hurry :)\nAlexey Tolstokozhev (btw, in Russian his name means 'Thick Skin'), a Russian spammer, found murdered in his luxury house near Moscow. He has been shot several times with one bullet stuck in his head. According to authorities, this last head shot is a clear mark of russian hit men (known as "killers" in Russia).\nWho hated Tolstokozhev so much as to hire a hit man to assasinate him? Well, I guess you have about one billion e-mail users to suspect. Tolstokozhev was a famous spammer who sent millions of e-mail promoting viagra, cialis, penis enlargement pills and other medications. Links in these e-mails usually led to some pharmacy shop, which paid Tolstokozhev a share of its revenue. This is a well known affiliate scheme employed by spammers worldwide. Tolstokozhev is estimated to be responsible for up to 30% percent of all viagra and penis enlargement related spam.\nIn order to send millions and millions of unsolicited letters, Tolstokozhev employed a network of infected computers (so-called "botnet"), which he rented from hackers.\nHow profitable is spam? Well, the authorities say that Tolstokozhev has likely made more than $2 million in 2007 alone. (in comparison: average russian monthly salary is $400)\nThis is a second murder of a spammer in Russia. Another russian spammer, Vardan Kushnir, was assassinated in 2005.\n"Violent murders is a clear sign that spam becomes a serious criminal activity" - the officials say. "Easy money attracts criminals, which bring their own version of "justice" with them."\nUPDATE: because of a huge amount of traffic this post received, I had to temporarily shutdown the blog leaving only the cache version of this post.

The aim of this report is not to question or to fight a belief ? the right to freedom of belief does not permit that. The aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science. It is necessary to separate belief from science. It is not a matter of antagonism. Science and belief must be able to coexist. It is not a matter of opposing belief and science, but it is necessary to prevent belief from opposing science.\n2. For some people the Creation, as a matter of religious belief, gives a meaning to life. Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Assembly is worried about the possible ill-effects of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies. If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe.\n3. Creationism, born of the denial of the evolution of species through natural selection, was for a long time an almost exclusively American phenomenon. Today creationist ideas are tending to find their way into Europe and their spread is affecting quite a few Council of Europe member states.\n4. The prime target of present-day creationists, most of whom are Christian or Muslim, is education. Creationists are bent on ensuring that their ideas are included in the school science syllabus. Creationism cannot, however, lay claim to being a scientific discipline.\n5. Creationists question the scientific character of certain items of knowledge and argue that the theory of evolution is only one interpretation among others. They accuse scientists of not providing enough evidence to establish the theory of evolution as scientifically valid. On the contrary, they defend their own statements as scientific. None of this stands up to objective analysis.\n6. We are witnessing a growth of modes of thought which challenge established knowledge about nature, evolution, our origins and our place in the universe.\n7. There is a real risk of a serious confusion being introduced into our children?s minds between what has to do with convictions, beliefs, ideals of all sorts and what has to do with science. An ?all things are equal? attitude may seem appealing and tolerant, but is in fact dangerous.\n8. Creationism has many contradictory aspects. The ?intelligent design? idea, which is the latest, more refined version of creationism, does not deny a certain degree of evolution. However, intelligent design, presented in a more subtle way, seeks to portray its approach as scientific, and therein lies the danger.\n9. The Assembly has constantly insisted that science is of fundamental importance. Science has made possible considerable improvements in living and working conditions and is a not insignificant factor in economic, technological and social development. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with divine revelation but is built on facts.\n10. Creationism claims to be based on scientific rigour. In actual fact the methods employed by creationists are of three types: purely dogmatic assertions; distorted use of scientific quotations, sometimes illustrated with magnificent photographs; and backing from more or less well-known scientists, most of whom are not specialists in these matters. By these means creationists seek to appeal to non-specialists and sow doubt and confusion in their minds.\n11. Evolution is not simply a matter of the evolution of humans and of populations. Denying it could have serious consequences for the development of our societies. Advances in medical research with the aim of effectively combating infectious diseases such as AIDS are impossible if every principle of evolution is denied. One cannot be fully aware of the risks involved in the significant decline in biodiversity and climate change if the mechanisms of evolution are not understood.\n12. Our modern world is based on a long history, of which the development of science and technology forms an important part. However, the scientific approach is still not well understood and this is liable to encourage the development of all manner of fundamentalism and extremism. The total rejection of science is definitely one of the most serious threats to human rights and civic rights.\n13. The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements. The creationist movements possess real political power. The fact of the matter, and this has been exposed on several occasions, is that some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.\n14. All leading representatives of the main monotheistic religions have adopted a much more moderate attitude. Pope Benedict XVI, for example, as his predecessor Pope John-Paul II, today praises the role of the sciences in the evolution of humanity and recognises that the theory of evolution is ?more than a hypothesis?.\n15. The teaching of all phenomena concerning evolution as a fundamental scientific theory is therefore crucial to the future of our societies and our democracies. For that reason it must occupy a central position in the curriculum, and especially in the science syllabus, as long as, like any other theory, it is able to stand up to thorough scientific scrutiny. Evolution is present everywhere, from medical overprescription of antibiotics that encourages the emergence of resistant bacteria to agricultural overuse of pesticides that causes insect mutations on which pesticides no longer have any effect.\n16. The Council of Europe has highlighted the importance of teaching about culture and religion. In the name of freedom of expression and individual belief, creationist ideas, as any other theological position, could possibly be presented as an addition to cultural and religious education, but they cannot claim scientific respectability.\n17. Science provides irreplaceable training in intellectual rigour. It seeks not to explain ?why things are? but to understand how they work.\n18. Investigation of the creationists? growing influence shows that the arguments between creationism and evolution go well beyond intellectual debate. If we are not careful, the values that are the very essence of the Council of Europe will be under direct threat from creationist fundamentalists. It is part of the role of the Council?s parliamentarians to react before it is too late.\n19. The Parliamentary Assembly therefore urges the member states, and especially their education authorities:\n19.1. to defend and promote scientific knowledge;\n19.2. strengthen the teaching of the foundations of science, its history, its epistemology and its methods alongside the teaching of objective scientific knowledge;\n19.3. to make science more comprehensible, more attractive and closer to the realities of the contemporary world;\n19.4. to firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion;\n19.5. to promote the teaching of evolution as a fundamental scientific theory in the school curriculum.\n20. The Assembly welcomes the fact that 27 Academies of Science of Council of Europe member states signed, in June 2006, a declaration on the teaching of evolution and calls on academies of science that have not yet done so to sign the declaration.\n1 Assembly debate on 4 October 2007 (35th Sitting) (see Doc. 11375, report of the Committee on Culture, Science and Education, rapporteur: Mrs Brasseur). Text adopted by the Assembly on 4 October 2007 (35th Sitting).\nAdresse | Contact us webmaster.assembly@coe.int ...	2007-10-11 00:00:00	http://reddit.com/goto?rss=true&id=2yxu4	1

Madonna quits Warner.\nYour browser does not support iframes. To visit the page follow this link\nPop star Madonna is close to leaving her long-time Warner Bros. Records label for a wide-ranging $US120 million (A$134 million) deal with concert promotion firm Live Nation, a source familiar with the talks said on Wednesday.\nThe story was first reported on the Wall Street Journal's website, which said Madonna would receive a mix of cash and stock in exchange for allowing Live Nation to distribute three studio albums, promote concert tours, sell merchandise and license her name.\nSuch a deal is virtually unprecedented, but may become more common as struggling record labels and other players in the music industry seek to shore up revenues by going into business with musical acts, rather than just taking fees for selling their albums or concert tickets.\nA Live Nation spokesman declined comment. A source familiar with Warner confirmed the basic details of the report.\nThe 49-year-old singer has recorded for the Warner Music Group-owned label her entire career, stretching back to her 1983 self-titled debut album.\nShe still owes Warner Music a new studio CD and a greatest-hits package, a label spokeswoman said in August, when speculation of a tie-up with Live Nation first surfaced. Her last album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, came out in 2005.\nLive Nation's diversification from promoting concerts to entering complex business partnerships with music stars is a sign of the times in the ailing music industry.\nAs the traditional recorded-music industry fights a losing battle against internet piracy and other forms of entertainment, the labels are eyeing other revenue streams, such as artists' touring and merchandising revenues. Ancillary players, such as concert promoters, talent managers and ticketing companies, also are in the hunt for such deals.\nWarner Music reportedly sought to retain Madonna with a similar arrangement. In an unusual move, the company partnered with Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, the parent of TicketMaster, to try to counter Live Nation's proposal, the Wall Street Journal said.\nThe paper, quoting people briefed on the Live Nation deal, said the package includes a general advance of $US17.5 million and advance payments for three albums of $US50 to $US60 million. (Album advances are generally recouped from sales income.)\nLive Nation also is expected to pay $US50 million in cash and stock for the right to promote Madonna's concert tours. Although she does not tour much, she is a popular draw. She ranked No. 4 on trade publication Pollstar's list of the top acts in 2006, with North American ticket sales of $US86 million.\nReuters\nEmail\nPrinter friendly version\nNormal font\nLarge font\nWhen news happens: send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or "); us.\nSAVE 31% on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today\n1191696045334-smh.com.auhttp://www.smh.com.au/news/music/madonna-dumps-label-in-134m-deal/2007/10/11/1191696045334.htmlsmh.com.auReuters2007-10-11Madonna dumps label in $134m dealEntertainmentMusichttp://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2007/10/11/madonna_chains_narrowweb__300x421,0.jpgBreaking the chains...

54	Jackasses in traffic dispute crush mom, two kids between cars	The Associated Press: Mom, 2 Kids Hurt in LA Road Rage Crash\nGo to Google News\nMom, 2 Kids Hurt in LA Road Rage Crash\nBy ROBERT JABLON ? 9 hours ago\nLOS ANGELES (AP) ? A road-rage crash critically injured a mother and her two small children, who were crushed between parked cars, police said Wednesday.\nTwo men were booked for investigation of attempted murder in connection with the crash Tuesday in the San Fernando Valley.\nThe drivers of a black Nissan Maxima and a red Chevrolet Camaro got into a dispute shortly after 3 p.m. Tuesday in the Van Nuys area and began racing and weaving along city streets at 50 mph to 90 mph, police said.\nThe cars were "cutting each other off, they were jockeying for position," Detective Bill Butos said. "They were tapping on the brakes, one of the vehicles was tapping on the brakes, trying to cause the other vehicle to ram into the vehicle."\nIn Reseda, the Camaro slammed on its brakes and the Nissan tried to avoid it and hit a parked car, Officer Jason Lee said.\nA 31-year-old woman and her two children were smashed between parked cars.\nPolice did not release their names. However, relatives identified the woman as Syeda Arif.\nThe woman was in critical condition Wednesday at a hospital.\n"She has lost one leg and the other leg is, unfortunately, crushed. They're trying to save that," Lee said.\nHer 4-year-old son was hospitalized on life support and his 8 1/2-month old sister was hospitalized in critical condition, Lee said.\nWitnesses said the younger child was "launched into the air and slammed against a tree, " police Capt. Ron Marbrey said.\nArif's husband, Amir Arif, told KCAL-TV that his son had massive brain damage.\n"It's a matter of time that doctor will take out his life support ... my son dies," he said.\nThe Nissan driver, Armando Gamboa Ayon, 19, of Pacoima, was arrested at the scene and the Camaro's driver, Brian Barnes, 44, of Northridge, later surrendered at a police station. Both were booked for investigation of attempted murder and held on bail of $1.5 million each, police said.\n"That could change if the 4-year-old ends up dying. It would be a murder charge," Lee said.\nThere was no answer at a phone number listed for a Brian Barnes in Northridge Wednesday evening. There was no listing for Gamboa Ayon in Pacoima or the surrounding area.\nThe crash was "entirely senseless, entirely the basis of two individuals that got into a contest of wills, if you will, over nothing more than a common traffic dispute ... over nothing more than whose car is on the roadway in front of the other person," Deputy Chief Michael Moore said.\nHosted by\nCopyright � 2007 The Associated Press.

They are truly nature's greatest survivors.\nTardigrades (Known as water bears or moss piglets) are some of the most interesting animals in the world, simply because they can survive so well in the most extreme conditions.\n(image credit: waterbears)\nCareful! It's got claws!\n(images credit: Willow Gabriel, Goldstein Lab)\nThese small, segmented animals were discovered by Johann August Ephraim Goeze, an aquatic zoologist, in 1773. Over 900 species of water bears have been found everywhere around the world - from the Himalayan mountains (at elevations of over 6000 meters) to deep ocean areas (4000 meters below sea level). They are most often discovered on mosses, lichens, and various types of sediments. An easy way to observe them is to soak a piece of moss in spring water.\nTardigrade in the moss water:\n(image credit: Jasper Nance)\nFreeze them, boil them, dry them, expose them to open space & radiation - after 200 years they'll still be alive!\nThe amazing thing about these tiny, 1mm creatures is just how resilient they are to about everything. You can put them in space, in hot sea vents, and freeze them - no matter what you do, they'll survive.\nsource\nYou see, Tardigrades can survive in:\nExtreme cold (at -272??C for a couple of minutes, or at -200??C for days on end)\nExtreme heat (being heated to 181??C for a couple of minutes)\nExtreme radiation (easily surviving 5,700 grays of radiation. A gray is about as much radiation as 5,000 chest x-rays. 10-20 grays can easily kill a human and most animals.)\nExtreme dehydration (A tardigrade can survive for a decade with no water)\nIn a vacuum (A water bear can survive in space!)\nThese tiny organisms can be found everywhere - in fact, there are probably hundreds just a few meters from where you are standing. They aren't as publicized as they should be, but these creatures are truly fascinating. It's amazing that these miniscule beings can survive for so long when others will die out.\nHere's to Tardigrades, nature's greatest survivors!\nThey are also kinda cute...\n(early Eutardigrade illustration, by Andrew Pritchard) -\n...and look great in art.\n(image credit: Norwood Matt)\n(image credit: solidgoldpants)\nAdditional sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n+StumbleUpon\nPermanent Link...\nCategory: Nature,Weird\nRelated Posts:\nFungus, Lichen and Moss, Photogenic Caterpillars, Strangest Plant on Earth\nDark Roasted Blend's Photography Gear Picks:\n...Subscribe to this feed...Scroll down to read comments -->>Post a Comment\nREAD LATEST POST:\nOctober 10, 2007 - Quantum Shot # 293\nNature's Great Survivors: Water Bears\nThese tiny creatures can withstand more than any other animal on the planet!\nOctober 10, 2007 - Biscotti Bits\nMixed Links & Images\nincl.

For this she was ordered to pay the recording industry $222,000 in damages, and she could lose even more to court costs and appeals.\nAll because she was among the 26,000 people sued by those Brioni suits known collectively as the Recording Industry Association of America, and hers was the first case to actually reach trial. The RIAA, faced with plummeting CD sales and increasingly restive artists, wanted to "send a message" to all the lowlifes out there who download music for free and undercut their profit margins.\nThe message, apparently, is this: "We're idiots."\nThe RIAA, after all, is the guardian of an industry so antiquated and oppressive that having sympathy for these guys is a little like feeling sorry for a Georgia slaveholder after watching Sherman's troops fire his mansion and scatter his livestock.\nSo when their first victim, Thomas, turns out to be a single American Indian mother of two making a measly $36,000 a year -- latte money for the RIAA boys -- you have a hard time picturing these guys nailed to a cross. But that's the image the RIAA has tried hard to foster since some pimply-faced intern first explained to them what file sharing was. All of a sudden it was, oh, boo-hoo. Poor us.\nCry me a river.\nHere's an industry so bloated with executives and middlemen, all of them greedily slurping up profit like bluepoint oysters, that the people who actually write the songs and play the music -- the "talent" -- are getting royally screwed in the royalty department. It's been like that for years. The Dylans and the Stones of the world might be able to rise above it and name their price, but for the rank and file it's "Dance to our tune, or go back and rot in that crummy little club."\nThe usurious nature of the business is the main reason that the average CD, which at most costs a couple of bucks to produce, routinely sells for upwards of $20. Sometimes the songwriter makes out all right (forget about the singer or the musicians), but licensing and contracts have been sufficiently rigged by the boys in legal to ensure that the lion's share of the carcass goes to people who have absolutely nothing to do with the actual music.\nIf there's an industry where the Marxist exhortation for the workers to control the means of production makes sense, this is it.\nSome artists are beginning to wise up to this. Thanks to technology (and when have you ever heard the Luddite say that?) bands are discovering that they can, in effect, become their own publishers, cut out the middleman and go directly to their audiences.\nRadiohead is the latest band to offer an album's worth of music online, for free. Fans are being asked to pay what they feel is fair, and my guess is that most people will kick in something. Given the chance to be reasonable, we usually will.\nThe record companies are greedy, not reasonable, which is why it's hard to get worked up at the thought of people sharing "their" music for free. Thieves stealing from thieves? So what?\nIt's this new artist-to-audience business model, though, that poses the real threat to the long-term survival of the traditional music companies. If you're among those who consider corporations and conglomerates to be evil incarnate, you'll be rooting hard for this new model to take hold. Not just for the sake of the little guy in the music world, but for the sake of little guys everywhere.\nMeanwhile, I think Jammie Thomas is going to turn out to be a public-relations nightmare for the RIAA. Crucifying someone who falls into about five demographically challenged categories to "send a message" hardly represents sound battle tactics for an entity already perceived as arrogant and overweening.\nTalk about a Pyrrhic victory. - - -\nTony Long is copy chief at Wired News.\nAdd this to:\nDigg\nDel.icio.us\nSphere\nSee Also:\nListening Post: Radiohead Fans Aren't Stiffing the Band for In Rainbows\nRIAA Copyright Campaign Finally Goes to Trial\nThreat Level: RIAA Juror - 'We Wanted to Send a Message'\nOn the Road at 50 Remains an Anthem for the 'Crazy Ones'\nEverybody Whiffs in the Barry Bonds Steroid Saga\nSearch Wired Top Stories Magazine Wired Blogs All Wired\nRelated Topics:\nEmail Article\nPrint\nFull Page\nComments\nSponsored by:\nMost Popular\nMost Commented\nPopular Today on Wired\nFlight of the Extreme UAVs, From Smallest to Deadliest\nGetting Things Done Guru David Allen and His Cult of Hyperefficiency\nDoggie Style: Cell Phones, Webcams and GPS for Hounds\nVideo Sites Help Scientists Show Instead of Tell\nWhat's Inside: Colgate Whitening Oxygen Bubbles Brisk Mint Toothpaste\nNobel Rumors Boost 'Draft Gore' Activists\nAudio Forensics Experts Reveal (Some) Secrets\nA Muslim Astronaut's Dilemma: How to Face Mecca From Space\nThe Best: Unlikely Movie Scientists.

"I think he's been overly persuasive on President George Bush and quite often he's prevailed."\nAsked to comment on Carter's remarks, Megan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Republican vice president, said, "We're not going to engage in this type of rhetoric."\nCarter, a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981 and won the 2002 Nobel Peace prize for his charitable work, is a strong critic of the Iraq war and has often been outspoken in his criticism of President George W. Bush.\nIn a newspaper interview in May, Carter called the Bush administration the "worst in history" in international relations.\nCarter did have kind words in the BBC interview for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n"I'm filled with admiration for Condoleezza Rice in standing up to (Cheney) which she did even when she was in the White House under President George W. Bush," Carter said, referring to Rice's former role as White House national security adviser.\n"Now secretary of state, her influence is obviously greater than it was then and I hope she prevails," Carter added.\n� Reuters2007All rights reserved\nalso on reuters\nSlideshow: Olympic gymnast hopefuls train in China\nSUVs post mixed results in insurer group tests\nVideo: Indonesian mother creates the Muslim Barbie\n'; document.getElementById("slideshowStatus").innerHTML = (intIndex + 1) + " of " + arrArticleImageIds.length; if (intSlideshowTracking == true) { dcsMultiTrack('DCSext.VirtualEvent', '1', 'DCSext.rChannel','Inline Slideshow','WT.cg_n','Inline Slideshow - Photo','WT.cg_s','','DCSext.DartZone','','DCSext.ContentType','Pictures'); } } function launchArticleSlideshow() { commonPopup('/news/pictures/articleslideshow?articleId=USN1026419120071010&start='+(intSlideshowPosition+1),920,585,3,'reutersSlideshow'); } function drawControls() { if (arrArticleImageIds.length > 1) { document.write('\n'); document.write(''); document.write(''); document.write('1 of ' + (arrArticleImageIds.length) + ''); document.write('Full Size'); document.getElementById("articlePhoto").className = "articlePhoto"; } else { document.write('\n'); document.write('1 of 1'); document.write('Full Size'); document.getElementById("articlePhoto").className = "articlePhoto"; } } function nextSlide() { if (intSlideshowPosition  0) { intSlideshowPosition--; } else { intSlideshowPosition = arrArticleImageIds.length - 1; } intSlideshowTracking = true; loadInlineImage(intSlideshowPosition); } function buttonMenu() { return false; } function buttonPush(e) { if (!e) var e = window.event; if (e.button != 2) { document.getElementById(this.id).style.cssText = "margin: 2px 0px 0px 2px;"; } } function buttonRelease(e) { if (!e) var e = window.event; if (e.button != 2) { document.getElementById(this.id).style.cssText = "margin: 1px;"; } } function initSlideshow() { if (arrArticleImageIds.length > 1) { document.getElementById("slideshowL").onclick = prevSlide; document.getElementById("slideshowR").onclick= nextSlide; document.getElementById("slideshowL").oncontextmenu = buttonMenu; document.getElementById("slideshowR").oncontextmenu= buttonMenu; document.getElementById("slideshowL").onmousedown = buttonPush; document.getElementById("slideshowR").onmousedown = buttonPush; document.getElementById("slideshowL").onmouseup = buttonRelease; document.getElementById("slideshowR").onmouseup = buttonRelease; } }\npowered by Sphere\nFeatured Broker sponsored link\n'); if ((!document.images && navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Mozilla/2.") >= 0) || navigator.userAgent.indexOf("WebTV") >= 0) { document.write(''); document.write(''); } }\n'); } for (i=0; i\nEditor's Choice\nA selection of our best photos from the past 24 hours.

The Anti-Piracy Equation Just Doesn?t Add Up ? The Seminal :: Independent Media and Politics\nThe Seminal :: Independent Media and Politics\nEducation\nThe Anti-Piracy Equation Just Doesn?t Add Up\nPosted by J-Ro\nPowered by Gregarious (41)\nIf you like what you've read, please vote!\nIf you're new to The Seminal, welcome!\nTo stay updated you may want to subscribe to our RSS feed, bookmark the site, or enter your email address in the form on the right to receive a daily digest of our articles. After that, please join the discussion and leave us some comments. Thanks for visiting!\nThe RIAA was given a victory October 4th when a jury awarded them $222,000 in a landmark case against a file sharing single mother, Jammie Thomas. As many have noted, the case was something of a perfect storm for the record industry, involving a long-standing username, one computer that could be matched to the offending IP address, and a technically savvy defendant. Still, the news is being touted as a victory for the industry in their misguided fight against music ?pirates.?\nThe problem is, this equation doesn?t add up. Here?s how it?s supposed to work:\nThe music industry sues file sharers\nThe music industry wins its lawsuits\nSomething magical happens\nPeople stop file sharing\nGoing from step one to step two is hard enough. The Thomas suit is one of the first clear victories in court the RIAA has had, after suffering numerous setbacks and settling many cases before trial. But it?s going from step two to step four that really doesn?t make sense. According to most statistics I can find, file sharing has only increased since the RIAA started treating its customers like criminals in 2003. Some sites put that increase at over 300%. Clearly, the ?message? the RIAA was trying to send to file sharers isn?t getting through. In fact, despite high profile events like the Thomas case, you are more likely to be struck by lightning than to get sued by the record industry.\nSo, if these lawsuits fail to deter copyright infringement, surely they must be doing some good, right? Let?s run the numbers.\nThe record industry collectively pays the RIAA (most likely) millions of dollars per year. (The actual numbers are impossible to find, but they do have over a half million dollars in their lobbying budget, so their full operating budget must be pretty high.) The RIAA in turn pays its high priced lawyers an exorbitant amount to sue children, dead grannies, and college students, all people without a lot of money, shallow pockets as they say. Indeed, while it was once thought that the RIAA broke even on most of its lawsuits, they are actually losing quite a bit of money on each one.\nBut here?s the kicker: Even if the RIAA settles or wins a court judgement, even if the lawsuit isn?t thrown out of court for the frivolous piece of litigation it is, the artists who actually make the music that is being stolen don?t receive one thin dime back from the RIAA. That?s right, the artists who slave for years to make records, pour out their souls into their CDs, and enrich our lives in a myriad of ways don?t actually get any of the money recovered through these ridiculous lawsuits. Not one red cent.\nNext time you wonder why CDs are $20, I think I have an answer for you. This system is broken. There is no reason to support the record industry by purchasing music. If you want to support artists, download their music for free and send them a crisp, new $5 bill. They?ll appreciate it a lot more, trust me.\nBookmark to:\nEmail this post...\nIf you liked what you read, subscribe to our RSS feed to stay up to date on our latest articles.\nFURTHER READING:\nCongressman Introduces Bill to Use Education Funding to Support the RIAA - April 6, 2007\nNew Poll: Scooter Libby?s Commutation - July 3, 2007\nSenate Republicans Block Debate on Resolution . . . - February 17, 2007\nTags: copyright, culture, music, Music Tuesdays, RIAA\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJ-Ro is a musician and designer.

They were back in the ?60?s, they were in the ?70?s and ?80?s, and they are?in the form of file sharing?now. People sharing music isn?t stealing?it?s free publicity. It motivates paying behaviors like going to shows and buying other content.\nI argue that we would have a very different perception of acts like the Grateful Dead and Bruce Springsteen if it weren?t for good ol? bootlegs.\nI?d like to think that musicians that got into ?the business? because they like performing and making music and spreading their message to as many as possible understand this.

I have the feeling Mr. Gore will be doing some deep thinking this weekend and who knows... maybe he or one of his advisors reads reddit.\nWhat is on the front page of reddit today is on the front page of digg tomorrow. And on the front page of Drudge the day after that. And on the front page of the mainstream media the day after that.\npermalink\nmaynard 28 points 5 hours ago\nSpez and the reddit coders need to resolve the poll issue. Many people want polls. The reddit submission system is poorly designed for polling. And a comment in the submission isn't obvious enough for reddit newbies.\nThis is one problem that a bit of code could fix.\npermalink parent\nmorner 6 points 2 hours ago\nIf they put in a "make this submission act as a poll" checkbox on the submit page, all we'd get would be polls. Hundreds of them, every single day. It would destroy reddit-the-news-site overnight.\nThere already exist polling sites. If users don't like the "comment poll" model, then just set up a poll elsewhere and link in the submission; I actually can't think of any good reason why this isn't done more often.\nFinally, bear in mind that newbies probably wouldn't think of using reddit as a polling system unless they saw a "vote up if [condition]" submission every week. In fact, as far as I can tell, polling is mostly conducted as an exercise in karma whoring.\npermalink parent\nmaynard 4 points 2 hours ago\n'news' site?

For one, no need to, unlike Obama who might see it as legitimizing.\nSo, out of the entire field... I could see him choosing Obama as VP. Politically, it's the smart decision.\nOf course, make no mistake: I don't want Gore in the whitehouse, and I'm not even certain that he's somehow slightly better than Hillary. If he is, it's such a small difference as to be insignificant.\npermalink parent\nponder22875 2 points 1 hour ago\nI think Gore would change things where as Hillary would just take us back to the 90's with jobs that dont pay as much which would be pretty close to what we have now. Except for the evangelicals terrorized by the WH instead of the ACLU.\npermalink parent\nNoMoreNicksLeft 1 point 1 hour ago\nNone of the insiders want change. And people have some obscene aversion to ever electing an outsider. I don't vote for aristocracy.\npermalink parent\nponder22875 1 point 44 minutes ago\nI think Gore is a middle ground between the outsiders who want change and the insiders that do not. He wants change but has been an insider. I think this has been because the Dems washed there collective hands of him after 2001 until right before An Inconvenient Truth came out and suddenly once he had the media up his arse the Dems wanted him back but seemingly he was no longer playing nice because now he speaks like I have never heard him speak before. I think he may be too popular for the Dem king makers to be able to mold him in their images and we may get someone who can speak their mind. I think Obama has been keeping his head down thinking he can win an election with honesty but not the primary, I say this because his supposed programs and his moving speeches dont really match up and I think it is because he is trying to pull his punches to not come off as "unelectable". Gore on the other hand is highly electable as was proven in 2000 and in an election year when anti republican seems to have reached the levels that anti democrat reached around 2002-2003 it would be a nice little land slide that would in and of itself go a long way to healing the nation.\npermalink parent\nNoMoreNicksLeft 1 point 33 minutes ago\nI think Gore is a middle ground between the outsiders who want change and the insiders that do not.\nDude, he comes from a political dynasty that spans most of this century, if not longer. He grew up in all this shit, as a child. He's never known any sort of hardship. He's never had to work a real job.\nHe is as far from being an outsider as it is possible to be.\nHe wants change but has been an insider.\nWhat change? He'll open up elections and hurt the dem/repub duopoly? He'll spend 1/5th of our current yearly budget from then on? Root out corruption?\nHe doesn't want change... unless it's from you and me. He wants us to change.\nI think this has been because the Dems washed there collective hands of him after 2001\nWhat romantic fantasy are you confusing this with? I can probably name you one or two democrats who are being ostracized by their party, but he's never been one of them. You've probably not heard of those who have.\nbecause now he speaks like I have never heard him speak before.\nSo here you're admitting that charisma counts more than character?\nthink he may be too popular for the Dem king makers to be able to mold him in their images\nHe never had a chance to sell out, he was bought before he was born. And all of them are allowed to play, as long as they move the agenda forward. There's room for him to play around with his pet projects, if he has any.\nwe may get someone who can speak their mind.\nUh?\nI think Obama has been keeping his head down thinking he can win an election with honesty\nNo, he made his bid 8-12 years too early, and he's trying to figure out what schemes he can get away with to win the nomination. If this is what you think is honesty, there is no helping you.\nGore on the other hand is highly electable as was proven in 2000 and in an election year when anti republican seems to have reached the levels that anti democrat reached around 2002-2003 it would be a nice little land slide that would in and of itself go a long way to healing the nation.\nHealing what? Our impossibly deluded collective self-image? Our beliefs that we can continue spending more than we make, that we can ship off our industry to china, that we can let a private corporation decide how much money to print?\npermalink parent\nponder22875 1 point 2 minutes ago\nSo do you have the guns ready for the revolution or are you voting for whoever Rush tells you to? I am not meaning to be rude I am just wondering whether you think it likely that an armed revolution is in the best interests of the citizens of this nation, in other words will it succeed, or do you think all dems are Satan? I am more of a Paul/Kucinich supporter but of who is being offered up as viable candidates Gore is pretty perfect to win and not make things WORSE. Sad but that is all I am asking for at this point, who wont make things worse because I gave up hope of things getting better when we jumped of a cliff in 2001. I would prefer he was not part of a political nor an economic dynasty but I am much more concerned with not only beating the repubs< who with the exception of Ron Paul I think need a collective time out, but beating Hillary which is the dynasty that is currently driving me nuts Bush/Clinton/Bush/Clinton. Will this be good for the nation? What would you suggest. I am waiting for your better ideas because I would like some.\npermalink parent\nConsciousPilot 3 points 3 hours ago\nIf he does run, I doubt he'll be willing to make that promise. Notice how all the candidates who commit to pulling troops out immediately are pulling in single-digit poll support. The front-runners are all "not willing to make that commitment at this time", and I doubt Al would have the balls to break that trend.\npermalink parent\nmaynard 1 point 2 hours ago\nGore would do what he thinks is right. And you might not like that outcome.\npermalink parent\npujyboy -4 points 8 hours ago\nJust like H-dawg amirite?\npermalink parent\nshiner_man -2 points 4 hours ago\nIs it going to make you feel good when this poll hits number one here?

I will continue to downvote these regardless of my stance.\nit looks suspiciously like karma whoring, especially since this is your second one of these within 3 days.\npermalink parent\ndiamond 0 points 2 hours ago\nBut how is the alternative scheme not karma whoring? In fact, if anything, it might be more so. Because the hope is that a comment-based poll would be voted up by anyone interested in the subject (be they pro- or con-), whereas a title-based poll is only going to be voted up by those who support the subject in question.\npermalink parent\nmorner 3 points 2 hours ago\nThe comment-based poll should be voted up by anybody who thinks that the poll is valid and worthy content, the sort of content which reddit was explicitly designed to identify and publicise. "Vote up if [condition]" polls, on the other hand, will simply be engineered to strike a note with the userbase and therefore get a bazillion upvotes.\nFor example, a karma whore can plead: "vote up if you think Gore should run", for example, rather than "vote up if you think Gore should burn in hell"; the latter would garner far fewer upvotes and therefore far less karma. Conversely, the non-karma-whoring "comment pollster" would ask, "Do you think Gore should run," with "yes", "no" in the comments. Unfortunately for our hero, his by-the-rules submission will be spotted for the poor-quality content which it is, and he won't get any karma for it. "Vote up if..." submissions are inherently karma-whoring.\npermalink parent\nmorner 3 points 2 hours ago*\nCall me a cynic, but I must have missed the mainstream media's warnings of war on labour day weekend, their calls for a well-dressed protest, their analyses of the impending stock market crash, et cetera; reddit is far less influential than you think it is.\nNot that that's a bad thing, of course. Reddit is meant to be fun: it's meant to be something you can waste 20 minutes browsing over lunch. It was intended to become the den of paranoia and conspiracy theorising which it breaks out into every now and then.\npermalink parent\nKiddieFiddler 3 points 3 hours ago\nI think the part of reddiquette about not using submissions as polls has been negated by the userbase by this point.\npermalink parent\ndleite85 2 points 1 hour ago\nI know everybody hates this type of polling...\nThen don't do it, asshat.\npermalink parent\nharlon57 1 point 17 minutes ago\nThis isn't really too impressive.

At the same time, I would not vote for Al Gore (as in "I would not be allowed to vote for him").\nYou see, almost half of the people here on Reddit are not allowed to participate in the US elections. (It appears we are only allowed to participate in the aftermath, by having our countries invaded.)\nSo how should I vote?\npermalink parent\nNoMoreNicksLeft 4 points 3 hours ago\nKeep cash on hand, and have regular drills with your family about how to sneak across the border as refugees when we do invade.\npermalink parent\nkcjameson -2 points 4 hours ago\nHe didn't put much of a fight up for his last election, what makes you think he'll do the same now.\npermalink parent\nponder22875 1 point 1 hour ago\nI think he much like many others in the country had no clue how bad things would get and felt it more important to heal the nation with a result than to fight the Supreme Courts ruling. At the time I was pissed in hind sight I think he was placing the nation above his own narcissism and I feel this time he would fight for the exact same reason because the good of the nation demands it.\npermalink parent\nhappyofficeworker -4 points 5 hours ago\nIt appears we are only allowed to participate in the aftermath, by having our countries invaded\nOn the flip side, do you REALLY want Americans to be allowed to vote in your perfect country?\npermalink parent\njimv -24 points 5 hours ago* [comment score below threshold] show comment\nAl Gore is a goddamn joke, and now the Nobel Peace prize is a joke too for giving him one.

I'm disagreeing that it's as important as it's portrayed.\nMaybe we need to be scared into action, but I side with the climate scientists, who are largely much more sober about this issue. They still think we need to consider and plan for it, but it's not the apocalypse the media loves so much.\npermalink parent\nThem 7 points 4 hours ago\nWould you like a tissue?\npermalink parent\ndropthesoma -86 points 8 hours ago [comment score below threshold] show comment\nVote this up if you want to have every last sent you own taxed out of you by Al Gore.\npermalink\nCoastOfYemen 42 points 5 hours ago\nWell, no need for you to worry, as you clearly have no sents at all ;)\npermalink parent\nmrjames 2 points 2 hours ago\nb3ta?\npermalink parent\nstimcaps 25 points 5 hours ago\nActually, Gore wants to end the payroll tax which is likely the largest tax you pay.\npermalink parent\nTurkeyBacon 6 points 3 hours ago\nreally??! citations please. //off to do some researchin'\npermalink parent\nTurkeyBacon 19 points 3 hours ago\nnevermind. found it. http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Gore_calls_for_elimination_of_payroll_0918.html he's calling for an end to pay roll taxed in favor of pollutant taxes. in other wards it's just a tax swap.\npermalink parent\nchipt4 32 points 3 hours ago*\nBut a tax swap in the right direction.

77	In a surprise vote of 5 to 4, the United States Supreme Court have declared George W. Bush the winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize	Daily Kos: State of the Nation\nBREAKING: SCOTUS Declares Bush the Nobel Peace Prize Winner\nby Walt starr\nFri Oct 12, 2007 at 08:52:47 AM PDT\nOslo: A review of the ballots in the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize has shown that George W. Bush is the winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. James Baker III has been sent by the Bush Administration to coordinate efforts on the ground. The United States Supreme Court in a surprise vote of 5 to 4 have declared George W. Bush the winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\nWalt starr's diary :: ::\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, stated that "allowing Al Gore to win the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize violates the spirit and intent of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Consitution." Justice Alito was joined in the majority decision by Justices Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and Chief Justice Roberts.\nIn a strongly worded dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated "This court has no jurisdiction over the Norwegian Nobel Committee and thus cannot award the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to President George W. Bush." Ginsburg was joined in her dissent by Justices Breyer and Stevens.\nIn a separate Dissenting Opinion, Justice Souter wrote, "This is just stupid. I quit."\nThe Department of Homeland Security have now staked out Gore's Tennessee home in order to detain him until after the prize is awarded next month. James Baker III will be in attendence at the awards ceremony to receive the award in the former vice president's absence.\nTags: Nobel Peace Prize, Al Gore, snark, Supreme Court, 2000 election,

He held that no future nominee could possibly live up to the standards of pacification established by Bush. Further, in a bid to quash all counter-argument, he ruled that the Nobel Foundation could have no legitimate authority to determine winnners of a peace prize, or even to define what 'peace' consisted of.\nWhen queried about this somewhat sweeping indictment, he said: 'The Nobel Foundation is the legacy of a man who invented dynamite, and thereby put a horrific weapon in the hands of warmongers and terrorists. The funds with which they confer generous monetary awards are in fact 'dirty money'. They are a rogue organisation, and should be shunned by all right-thinking nations.'\nUnnamed sources hinted that the President was contemplating an invasion of Stockholm to secure his prize and thus settle the dispute once and for all. While refusing to confirm or deny this possibility, the President said: 'Bold action to end the wrangling!

"The way we will enforce the ban is through targeting sellers."\nPsilocybin, the main active chemical in the mushrooms, has been illegal under international law since 1971. However, fresh mushrooms continued to be sold legally in the Netherlands along with herbal medicines in so-called "smart-shops," on the theory that it was impossible to determine how much psilocybin any given mushroom contains.\nThat meant mushrooms were less regulated than marijuana, which is technically illegal but sold openly in small amounts in "coffee shops." Possession of "hard" drugs like cocaine, LSD and Ecstasy is illegal.\nThe government has cracked down on hard drugs and tightened controls on marijuana. It was expected to do the same with mushrooms after the death of 17-year-old Gaelle Caroff, who had suffered from psychological problems before her death in March. She jumped from a building after eating psychedelic mushrooms while on a school visit.\nBut the outright ban came as a surprise: The government had solicited advice from vendors, advocacy groups and the city of Amsterdam, which benefits greatly from drug-related tourism, on how to improve the situation.\nMushroom vendors suggested stricter ID controls to prevent underage buyers, and strong warnings against mixing mushrooms with other drugs.\nAmsterdam Mayor Job Cohen had suggested a three-day "cooling off" period between ordering them and using them.\nThe Justice Ministry decided those measures did not go far enough.\nThe problem with mushrooms is that "it's impossible to estimate what amount will have what effect," spokesman Wim Van der Weegen said.\nAround 500,000 "doses" of packaged mushrooms are sold here annually. According to a study published in January by Amsterdam's health services said the city's emergency services were summoned 148 times to deal with a bad reaction to mushrooms in 2004-2006. Of those 134 were foreigners, with Britons forming the largest group.\nDenmark outlawed mushrooms in 2001, Japan in 2002, Britain in 2005 and Ireland in 2006. Selling psilocybin-containing mushrooms is illegal in the U.S., but the status varies from state to state for spores, homegrown and wild species.\nMarjan Heuving, a spokeswoman for the country's Trimbos Institute, a drug policy think-tank, said mushrooms are not toxic and themselves pose no physical risk to users.\nBut she agreed that people's reaction to them is unpredictable, depending on factors such as weight; how much food they have eaten recently; their past drug experience; psychological health; and the setting in which they are taken.\n"The main danger to the user is that he will somehow hurt himself," she said. "I should add that that's extremely rare."\nSince Caroff's death, a number of other dramatic stories involving mushrooms have been reported in the Dutch press, including a 22-year-old British tourist who ran amok in a hotel, breaking his window and slicing his hand badly.\n"It's a shame, the media really blew this up into a big issue," said Chloe Collette, owner of the FullMoon smart-shop in Amsterdam.\nShe said each case also involved the use of alcohol - against the advice of sellers - but it was the mushrooms that were blamed.\nShe said that many herbal medicines have quietly been outlawed as well.\n"Every two months they're banning something. Ephedra, yohimbe, herbal 'Ecstasy,' and now this," she said. "I don't know if we can survive in the future."\nSince 2001, the government has gradually pared back the number of marijuana-selling coffee shops by refusing to renew licenses to stores in undesirable locations, such as near schools.\nCoffee shops in the southern city of Maastricht have begun demanding fingerprints from customers to ensure they aren't buying too much in one day.\nGrowers, including household growers, have been more aggressively targeted for prosecution.\nThe Netherlands remains a major Ecstasy producer, but has won praise from Washington for the crackdown. Seizures of a ton or more of cocaine from ships docking in the Port of Rotterdam - Europe's largest - have become routine.\nMurat Kucuksen, whose farm Procare supplies about half the psychedelic mushrooms on the Dutch market, predicted the trade will move underground as a result of the ban. Prices will rise, and dealers will sell dried mushrooms, or LSD as a substitute, to tourists with no guidance.\n"So you'll have a rise in incidents but they won't be recorded as mushroom-related, and the politicians can declare victory," he said.\n-----\nAssociated Press reporter Mike Corder contributed to this story from The Hague.\n� 2007 The Associated Press.

80	"Run, Al, Run " is the New Democratic Chant	Bill Katovsky: Waiting for Gore: "Run, Al, Run " is the New Democratic Chant - Politics on The Huffington Post\nThe Huffington Post\nWelcome | Edit preferences | Logout | October 12, 2007\nLog In | Sign Up | October 12, 2007\nHome\nPolitics\nMedia\nBusiness\nEntertainment\nLiving Now\nAll Blogs\nAll News\nHome > The Blogs > Bill Katovsky\nBill Katovsky| BIO | I'M A FAN OF THIS BLOGGER\nWaiting for Gore: "Run, Al, Run " is the New Democratic Chant\nPosted October 12, 2007 | 12:09 PM (EST)\nRead More: al gore, Al Gore 2008, Al Gore Emmy, Al Gore for president, Al Gore Nobel Prize, draft gore, Breaking Politics News\nThree down. One to go. Oscar. Emmy. And now the Nobel. Al Gore can complete the Grand Slam by declaring his candidacy for president. With this latest accomplishment, which he shared with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Draft Gore movement has been given a huge steroid-like boost.\n"Will he or won't he run?" For the past few weeks, it's been the question creating tremors of mounting interest on the left side of the Net.\nNow that he bagged the prize as predicted, we will see the following reactions:\n1. Online organizations like DraftGore.com and AmericaforGore.org will see a great surge of interest. This is the good, healthy kind of surge, the one that doesn't sacrifice lives in a fruitless war. There will be a spike of online signatures. Expect to see the numbers double and soon fly past 250,000. There might even be another full-page ad in New York Times which generated a ton of publicity this past week.\n2. You will see a ramp-up in effort and number of volunteers of grass-roots groups in Iowa, California, Michigan, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to get Gore's name on the ballot for upcoming primaries. All of this is done independent of Gore, and represents a remarkable validation of the inherent strength of democracy in action, and one freed from the corrosive influence of special interests and Beltway politics. If Gore does run, he is a lock to win Time magazine's person of the year award, but runner-up should be awarded to the Draft Gore movement.\n3. All this interest in Gore has to make the Hillary camp nervous. There he is, biding his time in the wings, saving boatloads of money by not campaigning, getting wonderful press and relishing every moment of his continual place in the media spotlight. Yet the instant he does declare --that's still a big if-- Gore is the only Democratic contender who can dethrone her as frontrunner. And it could happen quickly, like one of those Texas-size ice floes splintering off Greenland. It will alter the political environment overnight.\n4. The media will continue to heat up speculation about a Gore candidacy. It's an ongoing and fascinating news story with a great pair of legs, and is far more interesting than reporting on visits by Obama, Clinton, and Edwards to Dubuque or Manchester.\n5. The right-wing noise machine will do everything in its callous, abusive power to delegitimize Gore and his Nobel Prize. It will tread over old ground and use personal attacks because it realizes it can't defeat Gore on the critical issues that really matter: Iraq, health care, global warming. It will try to trivialize him. To sane, reasonable ears, still hearing stuff like "Gore says he invented the Internet" is completely silly, but it has resonating power among conservatives who get their marching orders from Limbaugh and Fox News.\n6. And Mr. Gore himself? How will he weigh the pros and cons of jumping in the race? If he had spent months in early 2001 laying awake at night tormented by being robbed of the presidency, one could assume that there will be plenty of restless nights in the Gore bedroom in weeks to come, right up until the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in early November. He can delay making a final decision until then. It's even to his advantage if he does.\nFor the time being, we are all Waiting for Gore. We're not even in the second act.\nBill Katovsky is editor of the just-published The World According to Gore: The Incredible Vision of the Man Who Should Be President\nEmail\nPrint\nComment\nEmail\nPrint\nComment\nBreaking Politics News\nComments (6)\n3 comments pending\nFAQ: Comments & Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts\nPost a comment\nChicagoJim (See profile | I'm a fan of ChicagoJim)\nHe can't wait until November because the state filing deadlines will pass. Most states require Gore to sign a statement of candidacy form, without which ballot petitions cannot be submitted. Even Al Gore can't win if his name isn't on the ballot. He needs to make the decision in the next week or so.\nI don't see how he will be able to look back and say he did all he could to stop the climate crisis from becoming a catastrophe if he doesn't run. For example, would the meeting on global warming in China that he was supposed to go to today have been canceled if he was coming as President of the United States?!\nReply | Flag as abusive'); | posted 01:44 pm on 10/12/2007\nstsparky (See profile | I'm a fan of stsparky)\nAs much as I want him to run - it'd be smarter for him to play kingmaker.\nImagine Gore merely suggesting for the good of the party that the ticket should be Clinton/Obama with positions in the cabinet for others.\nReply | Flag as abusive'); | posted 01:19 pm on 10/12/2007\nCautious (See profile | I'm a fan of Cautious)\n"Run, Al, Run " is the New Democratic Chant"?????\nSays who???\nHe's found his niche. He should stay there. I'm sure whoever he endorses will do just fine, and Al will probably have a place in the new administration.\nBut winning a Nobel Peace Prize does not qualify him as Chief Executive, any more than it did Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King, or the Dalai Lama.\nReply | Flag as abusive'); | posted 01:15 pm on 10/12/2007\ntherealredstateblues (See profile | I'm a fan of therealredstateblues)\n"5.

83	Did you know there was a designated United States Civil Flag of Peacetime?	The United States Civil Flag for Peacetime\nDeclaration of Independence - 1776\nArticles of Confederation - 1777\nThe Constitution for the United States, Its Sources and Its Application\nOur Enemy, The State by A. J. Nock\nThe Classic Critique Distinguishing 'Government' from 'STATE'\nTrial By Jury by Lysander Spooner\nUndermining The Constitution by Thom. J. Norton\nA History of Lawless Government\nThe Law by Frederick Bastiat\nThe United States Civil Flag of Peacetime\nWe the People of the United States,\nactually have two national flags, a military flag and a civil flag for peacetime.\nThey have several important distinctions and meanings.\nAlmost all Americans think of the Stars and Stripes "Old Glory" as their only flag.\nAnd IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!\nThe Stars and Stripes originated as a result of a resolution adopted by the Marine Committee of the Second Continental Congress at Philadelphia on June 14, 1777, for use on military installations, on ships, and in battle, directing that a U.S. flag consist of 13 stripes, alternating red and white; that a union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.\nPrior to, during the War for Independence, and after under the Articles of Confederation, smuggling was seen as a patriotic duty of the citizens of the thirteen independent and sovereign states, but after the ratification of the Constitution and the establishment of a new nation, smuggling needed to be stopped. The new nation depended on the revenue from customs tariffs, duties and taxes on imported goods in order to survive.\nIn 1790, with the customs laws firmly in place, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton set to work devising adequate means of enforcing the year-old regulations. "A few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports," Hamilton suggested, "might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of our laws." Congress concurred, and that year appropriated $10,000 to build and maintain a fleet of ten revenue cutters, which were to be placed under the charge of the customs collectors, whose responsibilities would be enforcement of the tariff laws. Along with financial responsibility, Hamilton demanded that the officers be servants of the people. "They [the officers] will always keep in mind that their Countrymen are Freemen and as such are impatient of everything that bears that least mark of a domineering Spirit."\nNine years later, Congress refined the revenue cutters' role in customs operations with the passage of the Act of March 2, 1799, known as the Customs Administration Act. In particular, Congress determined "the cutters and boats employed in the service of the revenue shall be distinguished from other vessels by "an ensign and pendant, with such marks thereon as shall be prescribed and directed by the President of the United States." Additionally, the Act permitted commanders of revenue vessels to fire at other vessels failing to respond "after such pendant and ensign shall be hoisted and a gun fired by such revenue cutter as a signal." By this act the Revenue Marine (later called the Revenue Cutter Service) ensign served as the seagoing equivalent of a policeman's badge, the distinctive sign of the vessel's law enforcement authority.\nThe job of designing the distinguishing ensign eventually fell upon Oliver Wolcott, who had replaced Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795. On June 1, 1799, Wolcott submitted his design to President John Adams for approval. Wolcott's proposal featured an ensign of sixteen stripes, alternating red and white, representing the number of states that had joined the Union by 1799, with the Union to be the Arms of the United States in dark blue on a white field. It is significant that Wolcott turned the arrangement of the stripes ninety degrees to vertical to differentiate the new revenue cutter ensign from the U.S. Flag, to denote civilian authority under the Treasury Department, rather than military authority under the War Department.\nThrough usage and custom, horizontal stripes had become adopted for use over military posts, and vertical stripes adopted for use over civilian establishments. The Civil Flag, intended for peacetime usage in custom house civilian settings, had vertical stripes with blue stars on a white field. By the Law of the Flag, this design denoted civil jurisdiction under the Constitution and common law as opposed to military jurisdiction under admiralty/military law.\nAlthough intended just for Customs house usage, the new Civil Flag became adopted by both customhouses and merchants, and others who could afford them, to show their civilian nature and not under military control. The practice of using the Customs Flag as a Civil Flag became encoded in law in 1874 when Treasury Secretary William. A. Richardson required all customhouses to display the Civil Flag.\nOn May 26, 1913, with the approval of Senate Bill S. 2337, (shortly after the fraudulent declaration by Secretary of State Philander Knox, that the 16th Amendment had been ratified, and during the same weeks that the Federal Reserve system and the IRS were established) the U.S. Coast Guard absorbed the Revenue Cutter and the Life Saving - Lighthouse Services, becoming a part of the military forces of the United States, operating under the Treasury Department in time of peace and as a part of the Navy, subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy, in time of war.\nThe Civil Flag used by the cutter service was modified, placing the Coast Guard insignia on the stripes in the field , and was adopted under Coast Guard authority, losing it's original significance of civilian authority, which by then had long been forgotten. As the Federal government acquired more control over the States and their citizens during and after World War II, by 1951 the original Civil Flag had been phased out completely, it's existence left as an artifact of time in a few old photographs and a rare mention in old books.\nToday, the last vestige of the Civil Flag, the U.S. Coast Guard flag, being under the civil jurisdiction of the Department of Treasury during peacetime, is identical to the revenue cutter ensign, but with the service insignia emblazoned on the stripes in the field.\nIt is still seen as the shoulder patch of U.S. Customs employees but it too now has the gold fringe signifying Admiralty/Military/Law Merchant jurisdiction.\nNathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, published in 1850 before the War Between The States has this description of the U.S. Civil Flag in the introduction, "The Custom House" ---\nSalem Custom House � 1850\nSalem Custom House � circa 1900\n". . . Here, with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbour, stands a spacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof, during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military, post of Uncle Sam's government is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico of half-a-dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingled thunder- bolts and barbed arrows in each claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow. But she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later -- oftener soon than late -- is apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows."\nBefore 1940, no U.S. flag, civil or military, flew within the forty-eight states except in federal settings and installations. Only state flags did. Since the 1935 institution of Social Security and the Buck Act of 1940, 4 U.S.C.S. Ch. 4 Sec. 104-113, by clever legal maneuvers the feds have entirely circumvented the U.S. Constitution, and have overlaid federal territorial jurisdiction on the sovereign States, bringing them under the admiralty/military jurisdiction of Law Merchant, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the law of Creditors and Debtors.\nSince then the U.S. military flag appears beside, or in place of, the state flags in nearly all locations within the states. All of the state courts and even the municipal ones now openly display it. In the last half century they have more openly declared the military/admiralty law jurisdiction with the addition of the gold fringe to the flag, the military flag of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\nSuch has been the path that has brought us under the Law of the Military Flag. This should have raised serious questions from many citizens long ago, but we've been educated to listen and believe what we are told, not to ask questions, or think for ourselves and search for the truth.\nThe Flag of Peace\nUS Civil Flags in 1919 at the end of World War I\nUS Civil Flag at the Eagle, Alaska custom-house,\non the Yukon River at the Canadian border, circa 1997\nPhotograph by Walter Kenaston\nTreason in Government!!

87	Do Modern Women Want a Beta Male?	Printer Friendly\nFrom The Sunday Times\nOctober 7, 2007\nWhat modern women want: a beta male\nMen are surrendering in the sex war, taking on the supporting role\nKate Mulvey\nLast week I went to dinner with an eligible doctor. As we were finishing the main course, I struck up conversation with the owner (Marco) in Italian ? I speak five languages. My date nearly choked on his linguini and spent the rest of the date mute. I had committed the worst dating faux pas: I had outshone my suitor.\nYet it would seem I am not the only woman who is wondering whether it is time to hang up her brain and turn into a Stepford Datee. In America research shows successful young women are hiding their accomplishments for fear that their academic achievements and financial kudos will scare off potential suitors.\nAnd it is no different here. Researchers from Aberdeen, Bristol, Edinburgh and Glasgow universities discovered that high-IQ women saw marriage prospects fall dramatically, but men with high IQs had little trouble finding a mate. They found that for each 16-point rise in a woman?s IQ, her marriage prospects declined by 40%, but the man?s chances of marriage increased by 35% with each rise.\nThe widespread view is that accomplished women are at a disadvantage in the marriage market because men start out by saying they want a strong, powerful woman and then end up running off with the secretary. I should know. A few years ago my Swiss banker found my conversation too arty and cast his attentions on a lovely Spanish girl who worked in his office.\nShould women pander to male insecurities? Self-help guides exhort us to flatter the male ego; don?t talk too much and let him make all the jokes if you want him to like you. Well I would rather skewer my eyes out than change my personality.\nSo what is the answer? Someone has to surrender in the sex war. Should women soften their image if they want to marry an alpha? Since the beginning of time anthropologists have told us women are programmed to seek a mate who can provide for her.\nWe all witnessed the implosion of the 1980s power couple. As women flexed their shoulder pads all you got were stressed couples who were battling for the same role and trying to find a slot in their diaries for dinner.\nBut now there is a third way. The second-generation feminists ? that is, women in their twenties and thirties ? have found a new way to solve the alpha-beta paradox. The 21st century sisters have a terrifyingly clear agenda when it comes to finding a mate. They map out their life plans early: rise to the top of their chosen career, get the smart house, the cute kids and curl up in bed with a loving beta male. The alpha girl doesn?t need Mr Alpha to sweep her off her feet and buy her a condo in town; she has enough money to do that herself. She is successful, confident and she wants a caring man who can pick up some of the domestic slack.\nPenelope, 34, a high-earning public relations executive, is married to an actor. They are both comfortable acknowledging that the wife is the chief breadwinner. So it makes sense that it is her career that gets fast-tracked. ?John is really irreverent and playful and after I have had people kowtowing to me all day, it is nice to be brought down to earth with a joke.?\nDoes he mind playing the supporting role? ?I love it that my wife is this go-getting career woman. I have never been into status anyway, so I don?t feel emasculated by the fact that she earns way more money than me.?\nTo better understand this role reversal, we have to look at the key social changes in the past 30 years. Since 1975 the number of women entering the workforce has increased by a third and in 2005 one-third of all managers were women. Women are better educated ? there are more women with advanced degrees than before ? and there are now more female trainee lawyers and doctors than male ones.\nThis creates a shift in the way women view marriage. With their increased earning power, women are less hung up on the Jane Austen model of finding a providing husband. ?Women can choose a man who has charm and looks, instead of going for the grumpy, ugly alpha just because he is solvent,? says Penelope. So is this a liberating thing?\nFor young women this shift in economic power has given them new choices. But what about the men? While it is true that many older men seem stuck with the ?man as success object, woman as sex object? idea and would never contemplate marrying a ball-breaking alpha earner, men in their twenties and thirties seem to be redefining masculinity.\nHaving grown up with successful women such as Margaret Thatcher and Madonna as role models, and with popular culture awash with fantasies of all-powerful women, from Lara Croft to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, men are not so uncomfortable with the woman in control. This value system recognises the trend of female supremacy, which while not as yet the norm seems to be pointing the way for future relationships.\nContact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The Sunday Times.\n� Copyright 2007 Times Newspapers Ltd.\nThis service is provided on Times Newspapers' standard Terms and Conditions.

It said the IRS didn't identify the source of rising income for the affluent, but said a boom on Wall Street has likely played a part.\nEmail Story\nIM Story\nPrintable View\nRECOMMEND THIS STORY\nRecommend It: Not at All Somewhat Moderately Highly Very Highly\nAverage (Not Rated)\n� Recommended Stories\nTop Stories\nGore: Award puts focus on global warming AP\nMom charged with buying Pa. teen weapons AP\nBush: Congress should pass trade deals AP\nUS-Russia missile defense talks fail AP\nVatican publishes Knights Templar papers AP\nMost Viewed: Top Stories\nLipsticks contain lead, consumer group says Reuters\nFamily beaten as YouTube party descends into chaos Reuters\nGore: Back to work on environment Reuters\nHomeless man is chess king of Washington AFP\nBlood of women and children stains Iraq's Eid AFP\nTop Stories Video\nVote on the war 5 years later CNN - Fri Oct 12, 4:18 AM ET\nPleading for wife's safety CNN - Fri Oct 12, 2:04 PM ET\nToo Young to be a Prize Fighter?

Globally, abortion accounts for 13 percent of women?s deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, and there are 31 abortions for every 100 live births, the study said.\nThe results of the study, a collaboration between scientists from the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Guttmacher Institute in New York, a reproductive rights group, are being published Friday in the journal Lancet.\n?We now have a global picture of induced abortion in the world, covering both countries where it is legal and countries where laws are very restrictive,? Dr. Paul Van Look, director of the W.H.O. Department of Reproductive Health and Research, said in a telephone interview. ?What we see is that the law does not influence a woman?s decision to have an abortion. If there?s an unplanned pregnancy, it does not matter if the law is restrictive or liberal.?\nBut the legal status of abortion did greatly affect the dangers involved, the researchers said. ?Generally, where abortion is legal it will be provided in a safe manner,? Dr. Van Look said. ?And the opposite is also true: where it is illegal, it is likely to be unsafe, performed under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers.?\nThe data also suggested that the best way to reduce abortion rates was not to make abortion illegal but to make contraception more widely available, said Sharon Camp, chief executive of the Guttmacher Institute.\nIn Eastern Europe, where contraceptive choices have broadened since the fall of Communism, the study found that abortion rates have decreased by 50 percent, although they are still relatively high compared with those in Western Europe. ?In the past we didn?t have this kind of data to draw on,? Ms. Camp said. ?Contraception is often the missing element? where abortion rates are high, she said.\nAnti-abortion groups criticized the research, saying that the scientists had jumped to conclusions from imperfect tallies, often estimates of abortion rates in countries where the procedure was illegal. ?These numbers are not definitive and very susceptible to interpretation according to the agenda of the people who are organizing the data,? said Randall K. O?Bannon, director of education and research at the National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund in Washington.\nHe said that the major reason women die in the developing world is that hospitals and health systems lack good doctors and medicines. ?They have equated the word ?safe? with ?legal? and ?unsafe? with ?illegal,? which gives you the illusion that to deal with serious medical system problems you just make abortion legal,? he said.\nThe study indicated that about 20 million abortions that would be considered unsafe are performed each year and that 67,000 women die as a result of complications from those abortions, most in countries where abortion is illegal.\nThe researchers used national data for 2003 from countries where abortion was legal and therefore tallied. W.H.O. scientists estimated abortion rates from countries where it was outlawed, using data on hospital admissions for abortion complications, interviews with local family planning experts and surveys of women in those countries.\nThe wealth of information that comes out of the study provides some striking lessons, the researchers said. In Uganda, where abortion is illegal and sex education programs focus only on abstinence, the estimated abortion rate was 54 per 1,000 women in 2003, more than twice the rate in the United States, 21 per 1,000 in that year. The lowest rate, 12 per 1,000, was in Western Europe, with legal abortion and widely available contraception.\nThe Bush administration?s multibillion-dollar campaign against H.I.V./AIDS in Africa has directed money to programs that promote abstinence before marriage, and to condoms only as a last resort. It has prohibited the use of American money to support overseas family planning groups that provide abortions or promote abortion as a method of family planning.\nWorldwide, the annual number of abortions appeared to have declined between 1995, the last year such a broad study was conducted, and 2003, from an estimated 46 million to 42 million, the study concluded. The 1995 study, by the Guttmacher Institute, had far less data on countries where abortion was illegal.\nSome countries, like South Africa, have undergone substantial transitions in abortion laws in that time. The procedure was made legal in South Africa in 1996, leading to a 90 percent decrease in mortality among women who had abortions, some studies have found.\nAbortion is illegal in most of Africa, though. It is the second-leading cause of death among women admitted to hospitals in Ethiopia, its Health Ministry has said. It is the cause of 13 percent of maternal deaths at hospitals in Nigeria, recent studies have found.\nMore Articles in International �\nNeed to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.\nTips\nTo find reference information about the words used in this article, double-click on any word, phrase or name.

And the decision to do this was taken, not because of 9/11, but as soon as Bush took office. So much for the idea that the extremely benevolent and trustworthy Bush administration just wants ?surgical? surveillance* to keep us safe from terrorists, eh? Could this program be Spencer Ackerman?s ?Project X??\nAnyhow, it?s late, so I can?t do this story justice, but according to Wired:\nAnd in May 2006, a lawsuit filed against Verizon for allegedly turning over call records to the NSA alleged that AT&T began building a spying facility for the NSA just days after President Bush was inaugurated. That lawsuit is one of 50 that were consolidated and moved to a San Francisco federal district court, where the suits sit in limbo waiting for the 9th Circuit Appeals court to decide whether the suits can proceed without endangering national security.\nAccording the allegations in the suit (.pdf):\nThe project was described in the ATT sales division documents as calling for the construction of a facility to store and retain data gathered by the NSA from its domestic and foreign intelligence operations but was to be in actuality a duplicate ATT Network Operations Center for the use and possession of the NSA that would give the NSA direct, unlimited, unrestricted and unfettered access to all call information and internet and digital traffic on ATT�s long distance network. [?]\nThe NSA program was initially conceived at least one year prior to 2001 but had been called off; it was reinstated within 11 days of the entry into office of defendant George W. Bush.\nAn ATT Solutions logbook reviewed by counsel confirms the Pioneer-Groundbreaker project start date of February 1, 2001.\nThe allegations in that case come from unnamed AT&T insiders, who have never stepped forward or provided any documentation to the courts. But Carl Mayer, one of the attorneys in the case, stands by the allegations in the lawsuit.\n?All we can say is, we told you so,? Mayer said.\nMayer says the issue of when the call records program started - a program that unlike the admitted warrantless wiretapping, the administration has never confirmed nor denied - should play a role in the upcoming confirmation hearings of Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey.\nMukasey will have to ?come clean on when this program started,? Mayer said. ?The entire rationale was that it was necessitated by 9/11.?\nWell, yes, Tooliani operative Mukasey should indeed be asked about all this. Hey, here?s an idea: Leader Nance could write Mukasey a Sternly Worded Letter!\nAnd this does explain why the telcos are lobbying so hard for retroactive immunity, doesn?t it?\nAnd now that we can be totally sure that Iraq was for oil?even in the absence of the suppressed records of the Cheney energy task force?and we know that massive warrantless surveillance was the order of the day immediately after Bush took office, it looks like what ?changed? after 9/11 wasn?t ?everything,? but just the catapult Bush used for the propaganda. Eh?\nNOTE * The trad press coverage of McConnell?s lying on ?surgical? was even more bogus than usual.\nBookmark/Search this post with:\n?

He was noted for his "smooth dealings" with civilians, according to a group of Myanmar parliamentarians in exile.\nLittle is known about his early years other than reports from opposition groups he was "an average student." He became a colonel in the early 1990s.\nHaving personally overseen the successful completion of hydroelectric dam, railway and road projects and sat on a series of military committees, Soe Win was seen as a party loyalist capable of putting plans into action.\nHe kept a low profile on the way to the top, being publicised for visiting coffee plantations and pig farms and donating money to hospitals.\nBut unlike his prime ministerial predecessor, who supported the idea of talks with the opposition, Soe Win publicly stated that the junta would not hand over power or commit itself to talks with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nA dissident website quoted him as saying that the junta "not only won't talk to the NLD but also would never hand over power to the NLD."\nLike many members of the military, Soe Win played a part in the crackdown on the 1988 democracy uprising which left some 3,000 people dead.\nHe left the Northwest Command before the attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy, but pro-democracy groups allege that he toured parts of the region to rally members of the junta's civilian arm, the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), to harass the NLD.\nDemocracy activists view the USDA as Than Shwe's personal militia, used mainly to intimidate opposition groups. Soe Win excelled in his role as a leading official of the group, according to the opposition.\nThe clash between supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD and a pro-junta group left up to 80 people dead, according to the party. The government said four people were killed and 50 injured.\nAung San Suu Kyi, 62, is the world's only detained Nobel peace laureate.\nShe has spent 12 of the last 18 years under house arrest at her lakeside Yangon home, with little contact with the outside world apart from a live-in maid and visits by her doctor.\nSoe Win had one son by his wife Than Than Nwe. He had a twin brother who also died last month, according to state media.\nEmail Story\nIM Story\nPrintable View\nRECOMMEND THIS STORY\nRecommend It: Not at All Somewhat Moderately Highly Very Highly\nAverage (Not Rated)\n� Recommended Stories\nFull Coverage: Myanmar\nOff the Wires\n4 Myanmar dissidents held in crackdown AP, 11 minutes ago\nMyanmar stages rally as UN envoy heads back to region AFP, 20 minutes ago\nFeature Articles\nWhere Are Burma's Monks?

112	Windbelt : Wind power breakthrough.	?\nScribeMedia.Org � Shawn Frayne?s Windbelt Wins Popular Mechanics 2007 Breakthrough Award\n.:Home\n.:Health\n.:Media\n.:Web 2.0\n.:Business\n.:Current Events\n.:Arts & Music\n.:Design\n.:Fashion\n.:Science & Technology\nShawn Frayne?s Windbelt Wins Popular Mechanics 2007 Breakthrough Award\nOctober 12th, 2007 | By: Curtiss Martin | Category: Clean Technology\nIf you?ve ever put a blade of grass between your thumbs and blown, you?re already aware of the force that drives Shawn Frayne?s ingenious Windbelt. A small amount of air passing over a thin strip of material can create frequencies that translate into sound waves or, in the Windbelt?s case, energy.\nFrayne?s device consists of a flat, taut membrane that flutters within its housing as air passes through it. At each end of the membrane are magnets that oscillate between metal coils as the band flutters, effectively creating an electric charge. According to the 28-year-old Frayne, prototypes of the Windbelt have generated 40 milliwatts in 10-mph slivers of wind, making his device 10 to 30 times as efficient as the best microturbines.\nFor his innovation, Shawn recently received a Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Award and I had the pleasure of hearing him speak during a conference held on the top floor of Hearst Tower.\nFrayne, now based in Mountain View, Calif., gathered a variety of lessons while studying at MIT, especially under the tutelage of Amy Smith (a 2004 MacArthur fellow) in her ?D-Lab? class. In this design lab, Frayne learned the politics of delivering technology to poor nations, as well as the technical aspects of mechanical engineering.\nFrayne remarked in a 2003 New York Times article on Smith?s D-Lab:\n?I learned in an economics class that if someone has a good idea and they can implement it in a third-world country, they can dramatically change the economy of the country?I was surprised by how much technology can affect the well-being of a people.?\nDuring his mid-semester break at MIT, Frayne traveled to Haiti where he acted as a consultant for remote villages there and helped locals solve their technical problems.\nIt was while Frayne was in Haiti, helping locals make charcoal out of biomass, that he came up with the idea for the Windbelt. He saw the need for small-scale windpower, as it could power LED lamps and radios in the rural villages there.\nAccording the Popular Mechanics article on Frayne:\nConventional wind turbines don?t scale down well?there?s too much friction in the gearbox and other components. ?With rotary power, there?s nothing out there that generates under 50 watts,? Frayne says. So he took a new tack, studying the way vibrations caused by the wind led to the collapse in 1940 of Washington?s Tacoma Narrows Bridge (aka Galloping Gertie).\nSo it was that the Windbelt was born. Frayne posits his invention within the realm of ?appropriate technology?, which roughly translates to mean ?accessible technology?. The Windbelt is made of low-cost materials, it is easily serviced and repaired by the local population that uses it and it is environmentally friendly.\nFurthermore, Frayne believes that the benefits of his invention can easily transfer from developing to developed nations. One example that Frayne gave during his talk involved the microsensors used to moderate air temperature and flow in large buildings (such as the 44-floor Hearst Tower, which carries a LEED Gold certification.)\nThe majority of these sensors (and there are lots of them) operate on battery power and before these batteries fail, they must be replaced. Frayne predicted that each sensor would cost close to $2000 over the course of its life simply to remain powered by these batteries. Instead, Frayne argues that his windbelt could be installed alongside these sensors in the air ducts, where the movement of the air would keep each sensor powered in perpetuity.\nAt that revelation, the mind reels with examples and applications of how such a simple device could be used across (and maybe even inside?) the planet.\nEach fundamental technology developed in the developing world can give birth to entire industries down the line. This simple tenant gives plenty of traction to Frayne?s innovation and it is an appropriate reason that he be rewarded and recompensed for his efforts.\nMy hat?s off to you Shawn ? I?ll be looking for you in the future.\n- Curtiss Martin\nBookmark and Share This Story\nRelated Articles\nEconSM - Social Media Meets Marketing\nEconSM - Social Media Meets Mobile Media\n1 Comment so far\nSocialpyramid October 12th, 2007 3:28 pm\nVery cool!

Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, who commanded coalition troops for a year beginning June 2003, cast a wide net of blame for both political and military shortcomings in Iraq that helped open the way for the insurgency � such as disbanding the Saddam-era military and failing to cement ties with tribal leaders and quickly establish civilian government after Saddam was toppled.\nHe called current strategies � including the deployment of 30,000 additional forces earlier this year � a "desperate attempt" to make up for years of misguided policies in Iraq.\n"There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight," Sanchez told a group of journalists covering military affairs.\nSanchez avoided pointing his criticism at any single official or agency, but it appeared a broad indictment of White House policies and a lack of leadership in the Pentagon to oppose them. Such assessments � even by former Pentagon brass � are not new, but they have added resonance as debates over war strategy dominate the presidential campaign.\nSanchez went on to offer a pessimistic view on the current U.S. strategy against extremists will make lasting gains, but said a full-scale withdrawal also was not an option.\n"The American military finds itself in an intractable situation ... America has no choice but to continue our efforts in Iraq," said Sanchez, who works as a consultant training U.S. generals.\nEmail Story\nIM Story\nPrintable View\nRECOMMEND THIS STORY\nRecommend It: Not at All Somewhat Moderately Highly Very Highly\nAverage (Not Rated)\n� Recommended Stories\nWorld News\n4 Myanmar dissidents held in crackdown AP\nIraq sends mixed messages on U.S. raid AP\nEx-general: 'No end in sight' in Iraq AP\nUS-Russia missile defense talks fail AP\nVatican publishes Knights Templar papers AP\nMost Viewed - World\nKnights Templar win heresy reprieve after 700 years Reuters\nEx-general: 'No end in sight' in Iraq AP\nPets hurled off bridge in Puerto Rico AP\nVatican publishes Knights Templar papers AP\nRumors fly in France of Sarkozy divorce AP\nWorld Video\nPutin talks tough on missiles CNN - Sat Oct 13, 2:06 AM ET\nTraining TODDLERS?, Pt.2 FOX News - Fri Oct 12, 11:04 PM ET\nNobel win good for 'greens' CNN - Fri Oct 12, 9:08 PM ET\nAround the World FOX News - Fri Oct 12, 9:06 PM ET\nSponsored Links\n( What's this? )\nFree Investment Guide\nHow to Invest Smarter from Ameriprise Financial. www.ameriprise.com\nHouse Payments Fall Again\n$180,000 Mortgage for $999/mo.

Once the preserve of family and close friends, the peck on the cheek is creeping into all walks of life. But no one is sure when it's suitable, and how many are appropriate.\nGreeting used to be a straightforward handshake, but not anymore.\nYou offer a hand and you get a cheek.\nYou give a nervous peck and then as you pull back you get offered a second cheek.\nOne kiss or two? With the other person hovering awkwardly on their front foot, you go back in at speed to finish the job, leaving you both blushing and giggling in embarrassment. At least a clash of heads was avoided.\nWelcome to the social minefield of greeting in 21st Century Britain - how to judge the expectations of the other person, without appearing over-familiar or uptight?\nDavid Cameron showed how deftly it could be done when responding to the unexpected second cheek offered by a woman he met in Oxford (see video, above).\nBut sometimes the wrong form of greeting can cause offence and provoke a diplomatic incident, such as when former French president Jacques Chirac refrained from his usual hand-kissing when he met the then Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett.\n'Excruciating' meetings\nAnd now the chaotic practice of hugs, shakes and kisses is sowing confusion in the once-stuffy business world, where not long ago taking off a tie raised eyebrows.\nThe start and end of meetings with clients can be excruciating, says Rebecca Williams of CHA, a workplace communications consultancy.\nGUIDE TO HUGS AND KISSES\nThe handshake is always fine, even with a stranger, says body language expert Judi James, but eye contact is important.\nThe air kiss should only come after you've shared a social discussion, such as lunch with a client. Two is becoming common.\nThe Sopranos hug-and-pat is increasingly common between businessmen and says "alpha-male". No pelvic contact.\nThe lips-to-lips is creeping into some industries but is unhygienic and rarely appropriate in the business world.\nThe hand-kiss favoured by Jacques Chirac could be seen as an insult in the UK and usually prompts giggles.\nBACK\nNEXT\n1 of 5 "There's a moment of tense awkwardness when a person leading the meeting kisses a client and everyone else gets a bit anxious - what do we do now?\n"Once two people kiss, they set a precedent and then we all have to kiss everyone. It can be really uncomfortable but protocol dictates that we have to."\nPeople working in public relations usually go for two kisses, she says, but it can depend on the nationality. In her experience, Americans don't kiss, Argentines have two and Parisians four.\n"We've no set number of kisses in the UK. A kiss on one cheek might be fine but sometimes you go for two because we've started to adopt other cultures. It all feels very unnatural."\nThe British weren't even good at the handshake and now there are other options like hugging, air kissing and even lip kissing, it's a minefield\nJudi James\nBody language expert She says she keeps a mental note with different clients, to avoid causing possible offence by accidentally "downgrading" a relationship from kiss to handshake.\nThis is an absolutely vital issue, says body language expert Judi James, because a greeting sends out signals of status and charisma and says a lot about your personality.\n"The British weren't even good at the handshake and now there are other options like hugging, air kissing and even lip kissing, it's a minefield."\nThis confusion has inhibited people because they are scared of getting it wrong, she says. Her quick guide is that handshakes are always fine, while kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of social relationship with, even if that's just a client you've shared lunch with.\nTwo kisses has become increasingly common but some people find that embarrassing and in France one is more intimate than two. Never say "mwah, mwah" because it smacks of insincerity.\nRed-blooded reserve\nIt's not the first time the British have got into a muddle by adopting continental mores without any established convention.\n"Someone needs to lay down the law - a handshake with anyone, air kiss after three meetings, two cheeks and the right cheek first, play golf together and you get a man-hug."\nHonecker famously kissed other heads of state While men commonly practise the kind of hug and back-pat seen on The Sopranos, there is always an avoidance of pelvic contact, to remove any sexual dimension, she adds.\nThere was, however, no such red-blooded reserve practised by former East Germany leader Eric Honecker, who famously kissed Leonid Brezhnev on the lips in 1979, an act which was immortalised on the Berlin Wall.\nOrganisations should clearly set out the expected levels of intimacy, especially between junior and senior members of staff, says Mark Millard, a chartered psychologist who helps firms and individuals improve their well-being.\nAnd one of the reasons why the British get so flustered about this, he says, is because they inflate the significance of a kiss compared to their neighbours.\nBut don't think the UK is becoming more intimate, says David Pendleton of business psychology firm Edgecumbe in Bristol.\nHOW MANY KISSES?\nFour: Paris\nThree: Brittany, Netherlands, Belgium (if other person 10 years older), Egypt, Russia, Switzerland\nTwo: Spain, Austria, Hungary, Greece, some parts of France\nOne: Belgium\nClose friends and family only: Germany, Italy, Middle East (except between male friends)\nDon't try it: Japan (bow) He believes kissing is a sign the UK is merely absorbing foreign trends at a dizzying rate while also being in a hurry to do everything, including forming relationships.\nThe confusion comes because there is a push to be more intimate at work - through exercises like team bonding - and a pull in the other direction from people hugely afraid of breaching equality and sexual harassment laws.\n"If we were heading for a more intimate business world, it wouldn't be confusing, we'd be hugging each other to death. But at the same time we see people massively nervous of anything other than a handshake."\nSo what's the best way to play it, in the boardroom and in life generally?\nThere are other ways to break the ice, says Mr Pendleton, such as a joke or a broad smile.\n"People can be smiley and warm while being mindful of the kind of personal space issues that people need to work within. Kissing is not the only sign of being confident and relaxed."\nA more succinct rule of thumb might be - be yourself.\nHere is a selection of your comments.\nAfter spending a week with some of my friends, all of whom kiss when saying hello and goodbye, I went out with some old friends of mine. Thinking I'd be proactive and friendly, I went to kiss one goodbye. She recoiled in horror, fearful that I was hitting on her, and told all of her friends about it! Talk about awkward.\nRichard Bridger, London, UK\nIn Eastern Turkey when you know another guy and you meet him again a hug and kiss on each cheek is expected especially in business circles. This is difficult for us conservative Brits where we are hung up about bodily contact between males unless we score a goal in football!!\nRichard Baker, Diyarbakir Turkey\nNever mind differences between countries, in Brazil there are also differences between cities. In Rio it's two kisses, whilst in Sao Paulo it's one kiss and even that isn't totally reliable due to the movement of persons between the cities. I now go for one kiss on the right cheek and if that's wrong make a joke of my doubt.\nPhillip Newman, Currently Sao Paulo, Brazil\nI live in the UAE and I have to say the Arabs kiss more than anybody else on the planet. We kiss like crazy, kisses on the nose on cheek, on the hand, and the shoulder. It varies from country to country. It's getting out of control! The only people I would kiss on the cheeks are my parents.\nRashid Mohamed , Dubia\nSeems like a middle-class thing to me. For working-class people like myself, you're lucky if there's any eye contact; let alone any physical.\nRuss Swindle, Maldon , England\nHaving lived my whole life between England, Switzerland and France, I now tend to greet people initially, as I approach them, with a handshake. As I walk closer in towards them, and if we have met once before, this is usually then smoothly followed with kisses, no airy nor slops, straight forward pecks - one to each cheek, or if family / close buddy then it could be three (pour la Suisse!) or four (pour la France!) - whilst still holding their hand. But I never do one kiss - feels unfinished, almost insulting. But then I am female! I expect and like kisses.........\nAnne, London\nHere in this part of France the norm is four, but three miles down the road in a different department/region it is two, and in other areas it can be three. The kids when meeting a large group of friends usually just do one.\nJohn, Saumur, France\nI'm reminded of a piece from "The Men from The Ministry" when they need to prove that they were British... "What would you do if a strange woman came up and kissed you?" "I would apologise at once!" "They're British"\nJames, New York, NY\nDon't forget that goodbye kisses can differ from greeting ones! My girlfriend's mum is Brazilian, and I often get the two kisses for hello, and one for goodbye but unfortunately this changes randomly so I always approach with much caution and see what happens. A lesson I especially learnt when I went to greet her French partner with a nice handshake. He went for the kiss and I ended up sort of pecking him on the lips...suffice to say a firm handshake is now our standard!\nKieran, London\nI come from Switzerland. Even there it's not always entirely clear. I had no idea, when I first came to UK, how many pecks to give. It always ended in the rather awkward "oh.. oops, sorry."\nDaniel Einars, Colindale\nI think it is fantastic that the great British reserve has loosened up on greeting friends and family with the two kisses. Much more friendly and cosmopolitan. I agree that a more formal handshake is appropriate in the appropriate circumstances. I used to work for the Leader of the Council in a local authority as her PA and we often greeted one another by offering two kisses. Fantastic\nChristopher Hall, Prestwich\nThis whole multiple kissing thing is utterly ridiculous. We're British; a firm handshake will suffice.\nClifford Hayes, Hastings\nTry Bermuda! Hand shaking is the way to go. Between men it gets complicated. Concentrate now....firm handshake...slide hands apart while maintaining contact all the way down the fingers...grasp the fingers(now hooked over)...at the same time rubbing the thumbs together...pull hands apart....form a fist....touch fists gently but positively. By which time the ice in your 'Dark & Stormy' has probably melted.\nMichael Swain, Hamilton, Bermuda\nTwo kisses in the social arena, one kiss for people you are close to and handshakes when on business is my rule. It is more difficult for colleagues - I tend to kiss those I am close to twice but only on social occasions.\nAndrea Guerra Fernandez, Southampton, UK\nAs a child I have always travelled and seen many cultures. I remember being in shock after my French exchange, my French pen pal telling me that I have to greet and say good buy to all the guests with four kisses. That's OK, unless you can't stand someone. I thought I was tactful and missed the person. I was in so much trouble with my pen friend, for missing one of her friends!!!! However I must say after the initial shock it is wonderful to have the warm welcome, a hug and a kiss. They say the French are happier and healthier due to the amount of kissing they do!\nElizabeth, London\nThis is a very real problem, especially when you work for a European company and move around between the UK, France and Germany! In France I tend to find close colleagues kiss twice, but this will not happen immediately, a bond has to be formed first. Germans prefer a handshake at every opportunity. The British as usual are stuck in the middle and when my French colleagues cheek kiss me in my British office it can be very awkward! A kiss from a Board member tends to be good... although it is still referred to as a "kiss of death" for junior employees!\nMartin, Newport / Paris / Munich\nIt's about time the British showed some humanity by kissing friends instead of the ghastly "alright mate?"\nCristiano, London\nI lived in Argentina for a year and everyone gets one kiss on the cheek, whether they're male or female, family member or new acquaintance. This even happened between doctor and patients! It was strange to begin with, but it solved a lot of awkwardness and I actually began to appreciate it. Some people in England, especially amongst the elderly, can go for too long without actually having any bodily contact with another person.\nJohn, Birmingham\nI just don't like being forced to adopt someone else's style - like when you go to shake someone's hand and they twist it up in a kind of 'cool' shake. Or when you are forced to multiple kiss someone you've never met. I might like licking someone's face when I meet them but I wouldn't expect them to go along with it. The whole thing is a minefield - I'd rather not meet anyone new now!\nSimon Evans, London\nYou should try living in Poland... Pole to Pole, three kisses is the standard. Living with a bunch of ex-pats where zero up to three are all possibilities, anything can happen! Most of us default to three, and hope the other person doesn't pull out midway!\nRob Berrington,\nE-mail this to a friend\nPrintable version\nBookmark with:\nDelicious\nDigg\nreddit\nFacebook\nStumbleUpon\nWhat are these?\nVOTE\nWhile in a pub, you meet a close work colleague of the opposite sex.

MOST INTERESTING NEWS FROM THE LINUX COMMUNITY, USEFUL ADMINISTRATION TIPS & TRICKS, WEIRD AND FUNNY FACTS YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T EVER HEARD ABOUT!\nFriday, October 12, 2007\nTen Funny Quotes By Linus Torvalds\n"Dijkstra probably hates me"\n(in kernel/sched.c)\n"How should I know if it works? That's what beta testers are for. I only coded it"\n(somewhere in a posting)\n"I'm an idiot.. At least this one [bug] took about 5 minutes to find.."\n(in response to a bug report)\n"If you want to travel around the world and be invited to speak at a lot of different places, just write a Unix operating system."\n(source unknown)\n"Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely unintentional side effect." (NewYork Times interview)\n"An infinite number of monkeys typing into GNU emacs would never make a good program."\n(source unknown)\n"Hey, maybe I could apply for a saint-hood from the Pope. Does somebody know what his email-address is? I'm so nice it makes you puke."\n(taken from Linus's reply to someone worried about the future of Linux)\n"When you say "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people just stare atyou blankly and say "Hey, I got those with the system, *for free*"\n(source unknown)\n"Other than the fact Linux has a cool name, could someone explain why I should use Linux over BSD? No. That's it. The cool name, that is. We worked very hard on creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able to say "OS/2? Hah. I've got Linux. What a cool name". 386BSD made the mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too technical."\n(Linus Torvalds' follow-up to a question about Linux)\n"The day people think linux would be better served by somebody else (FSF being the natural alternative), I'll "abdicate". I don't think that it's something people have to worry about right now - I don't see it happening in the near future. I enjoy doing linux, even though it does mean some work, and I haven't gotten any complaints (some almost timid reminders about a patch I have forgotten or ignored, but nothing negative so far). Don't take the above to mean that I'll stop the day somebody complains: I'm thick-skinned (Lasu, who is reading this over my shoulder commented that "thick-HEADED is closer to the truth") enough to take some abuse. If I weren't, I'd have stopped developing linux the day ast ridiculed me on c.o.minix. What I mean is just that while linux has been my baby so far, I don't want to stand in the way if people want to make something better of it."\n(source unknown)\n?????

133	VOTE UP if you want GEORGE BUSH in Prison!!	Alex Jones' Endgame\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n     \r\n    \r\n     \r\n      For the New World Order, a world government is just the beginning. Once in place they can engage their plan to exterminate 80% of the world's population, while enabling the &quot;elites&quot; to live forever with the aid of advanced technology. For the first time, crusading filmmaker ALEX JONES reveals their secret plan for humanity's extermination: Operation ENDGAME. \r\n      Jones chronicles the history of the global elite's bloody rise to power and reveals how they have funded dictators and financed the bloodiest wars&#8212;creating order out of chaos to pave the way for the first true world empire. \r\n      \r\n        Watch as Jones and his team track the elusive Bilderberg Group to Ottawa and Istanbul to document their secret summits, allowing you to witness global kingpins setting the world's agenda and instigating World War III. \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        Learn about the formation of the North America transportation control grid, which will end U.S. sovereignty forever. \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        Discover how the practitioners of the pseudo-science eugenics have taken control of governments worldwide as a means to carry out depopulation. \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        View the progress of the coming collapse of the United States and the formation of the North American Union. \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Never before has a documentary assembled all the pieces of the globalists' dark agenda. Endgame's compelling look at past atrocities committed by those attempting to steer the future delivers information that the controlling media has meticulously censored for over 60 years. It fully reveals the elite's program to dominate the earth and carry out the wicked plan in all of human history. \r\n      Endgame is not conspiracy theory, it is documented fact in the elite's own words. \r\n        \r\n          ENDGAME will be released on the WEB OCT. 26 and on DVD on NOV. 1\r\n      \r\n\t\t  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n\t  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Copyright &copy; 2007 Alex Jones	2007-10-14 00:00:00	http://reddit.com/goto?rss=true&id=2zuhm	1

State owned power generators are already banned from building gas fired plants and the decision whether to extend the ban to private companies will be made soon.\nThe goal is to reduce carbon emissions and generate 90% of the country&#8217;s power from renewable sources by 2025. New Zealand currently produces 70% of its electricity from wind, hydro and geothermal generators. The hope is the ban will speed construction in wind turbines and steam fields.\nThe ban affects two gas fired power plants currently under consideration. Genesis Power, the government owned utility, and Contact, New Zealand&#8217;s largest commercial power company, had planned to spend NZ$1 billion on the projects. Now the companies will need to look for renewable sources for their investments. Contact&#8217;s share prices rose on the Wellington stock exchange with news of the ban.\nIn New Zealand gas prices have been rising and gas production falling over the last 5 years. The higher gas cost has made renewable power cost competitive and Contact has spend NZ$2 billion on wind and geo-thermal  electricity production capability. The company want the government to speed up approval of two new steam plants on the North Island.\nNew Zealand is well on its way to a renewable energy future and this step increases the pace of getting there. Let us see if other countries can take similar steps.\nSource: Bloomberg.com\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was written by Tim Plaehn and posted on October 13, 2007 at 5:30 pm and filed under Alternative Energy,  Green Tech.

The RIAA&#39;s four-year-old lawsuit campaign is costing the music industry millions of dollars and is a big money-loser for the record labels. The revelation came during the first day of Capitol Records v. Jammie Thomas, the first file-sharing case to go to trial (it was formerly known as Virgin v. Thomas, but the sole Virgin Records track was stricken from the complaint, making Capitol Records the lead plaintiff). \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a relatively calm morning session, proceedings resumed after lunch. After RIAA lead counsel Richard Gabriel finished his direct examination, Thomas&#39; attorney Brian Toder began his attempts to undermine the labels&#39; case. He focused on apparent inconsistencies from the testimony of Jennifer Pariser, Sony BMG&#39;s the head of litigation. Toder also got Pariser to admit that IP addresses and screenshots &quot;don&#39;t identify human beings.&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nPariser also said she had no idea why Virgin Records dropped its part of the case. &quot;The RIAA and the plaintiffs have the same lawyer and coordinate the lawsuits,&quot; Toder noted. &quot;You don&#39;t know why they bailed on the case?&quot; Pariser said she had enough trouble keeping track of Sony&#39;s litigation, let alone what the other companies are doing. Perhaps&mdash;and this is just a guess&mdash;it&#39;s the money. \r\n\r\nLawsuits are punitive, not business&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest bombshells from the cross-examination was Pariser&#39;s admission that the RIAA&#39;s legal campaign isn&#39;t making the labels any money, and that, furthermore, the industry has no idea of the actual damages it suffers due to file-sharing. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe admission came during questioning over the amount of damages the RIAA is seeking in the case. Toder asked Pariser how much Sony was suing the defendant for, and she replied that the amount was for the jury to decide and that the labels&nbsp;weren&#39;t suing for actual damages. As is the case with the other file-sharing lawsuits, the record industry is only seeking the punitive damages available via the Copyright Act, which can range from $750 to $150,000 per song. &quot;What are your actual damages?&quot; asked Toder.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;We haven&#39;t stopped to calculate the amount of damages we&#39;ve suffered due to downloading, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s at issue here,&quot; replied Pariser, who was reminded by Judge Michael Davis to answer the questions actually asked by Toder, not hypotheticals. \r\n\r\n\r\nToder then pressed the Sony executive on the question of how many people actually downloaded music from the defendant. &quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; she replied. &quot;I can&#39;t identify any other entities aside from what SafeNet reported, but I know that many others did... that&#39;s the way the system works.&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nToder then raised the question of the RIAA targeting the wrong people in its lawsuits. &quot;How many dead people have you sued?&quot; he asked, a question that was blocked after Gabriel objected. Toder then took a different tack, asking&nbsp;Pariser&nbsp;if she recognized the names of Gertrude Walton, Sarah Ward, Cindy Chan, and Paul Wilke&mdash;all innocent victims of the RIAA&#39;s driftnet tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next line of questioning was how many suits the RIAA has filed so far. Pariser estimated the number at a &quot;few thousand.&quot; &quot;More like 20,000,&quot; suggested Toder. &quot;That&#39;s probably an overstatement,&quot; Pariser replied. She then made perhaps the most startling comment of the day. Saying that the record labels have spent &quot;millions&quot; on the lawsuits, she then said that &quot;we&#39;ve lost money on this program.&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nThe RIAA&#39;s settlement amounts are typically in the neighborhood of $3,000-$4,000 for those who settle once they receive a letter from the&nbsp;music industry. On the other side of the balance sheet is the amount of money paid to SafeNet (formerly MediaSentry) to conduct its investigations, and the cash spent on the&nbsp;RIAA&#39;s legal team and on local counsel to help with the various cases. As&nbsp;Pariser admitted under oath today,&nbsp;the entire campaign is&nbsp;a money pit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\t\r\n        Filed under: File-sharing, RIAA, Music, Capitol v.

Critics of the war have often voiced suspicions of such imperial schemes, but this is the first time that a high-ranking former military officer has claimed to know that such plans existed.\n\nThe existence of that classified memo would certainly cast more dubious light not only on the original decision to invade Iraq because of Iran.\n\nIn "A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country," published by Palgrave Macmillan last month, the former four-star general recalls two visits to the Pentagon following the terrorist attacks of September 2001. \n\t\n\n\nNext\nNext\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tShare\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEmail\n\t\t\tDigg\n\t\t\tDel.icio.us\n\t\t\tReddit\n\t\t\tMy Yahoo\n\t\t\n\t\n\tPrint\n\tRSS\n\tFont: S / S+ / S++\n\n\n\n\n      \n\t\t                   \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tRead all letters on this article (53)\n\tRead Editor's Choice letters on this article (6)\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tView blog reactions\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                 \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCurrent Opinion\n\t\t\t\n American flag pins are for idiots This generation doesn't sacrifice or even pay for our wars.

As a handicapped person, I get infuriated when there are no electric carts left at the front entrance because most of the people using them are massively obese. Granted, some of these people have medical issues that require them to use one of these. But it is the obese individuals who take advantage of these who don't care enough to engage in a healthy lifestyle to lose weight.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\tMaybe your kid should get hit\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis is to the ignoramus who wrote about speeding in the school zones where children are crossing. Maybe he would like someone that was too impatient to wait for a child walking across the street to run over one of his children. This guy needs to be tarred.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tMan moves tree, then leaves\n\n\n\n\n\t\tLast Saturday, a huge pine tree fell across North Chaffee Road, blocking both lanes of traffic. A man in a Ford pickup stopped and said he had a chain saw and could cut the tree and move it off the road. ... In a few short minutes he had the tree cut, hooked the logging chain around the tree and with one pull with his Ford, dragged the tree off the roadway. As we stood there in awe of what this man just did, he got in his Ford and drove away.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWise's actions cross the line\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJoseph Wise has gone too far in asking for school board member Brenda Priestly-Jackson to resign. She may very well not live in her representative area any longer and can be forced to resign. This is nothing more than a distraction on Joey's part because of his own situation. ... This may be a ploy on Joey's part to have the Duval board demand his resignation and possibly pay out a hefty severance.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThe Town Center needs IKEA\n\n\n\n\n\t\tGreat news stories about the new Town Center but where is IKEA? ... We need IKEA. Also, why don't they put in a shuttle bus or a trolley out there ... at the Town Center to make it easier to get around?\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRacial hatred trickles down\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWho will benefit from all the racial hatred that is bubbling up all over the country? Personally, I think we are suffering from trickle-down hatred. There's no reason for John Gibson, Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter making these ignorant comments unless they are trying to incite more hatred and unrest.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tVote to cut insurance, oil costs\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWith all the price gouging by the insurance companies and the oil companies, I would suggest that we vote for any presidential candidate who comes out in favor of nationalizing both.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThere are several ways to "rant" or "rave" about something: Call (904) 366-6373 and leave a message; send an e-mail to rantsandraves@jack sonville.com; go to Jacksonville.com, keyword: T-You; mail items to Rants & Raves, The Florida Times-Union, P.O.

Bosnia had the second-lowest rate, with 1 in 29,000 women dying during pregnancy and childbirth.\r\n    \n\n"Among the ten top-ranked European and other industrialized countries, where women are guaranteed good-quality health and family planning services that minimize their lifetime risk, fewer than one in 16,400 will die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth," the United Nations, which issued the report along with the World Bank, said in a statement.\r\n    \n\n"At the other end of the scale are ten countries where high fertility and shattered health care systems raise women's lifetime risk so that more than one in every 15 women will die of pregnancy-related causes," it said.\r\n    \n\nThe report, published in the Lancet medical journal, places the United States 41st among 171 countries.\r\n    \n\nThe four lowest-ranked countries in the report are Chad, with 1 in 11 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone with one in eight, and Niger losing one in seven mothers.\r\n    \n\n"Americans tend to be complacent about pregnancy and childbirth. Most believe it is now more or less routine and no longer the deadly risk it was for their grandmothers. This is true for most U.S. women, but by no means for all," the U.N.-led group said in a statement.&nbsp; Continued...\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n      View article on single page\r\n         ');\r\n          } else {\r\n          \tdocument.write('Previous Page ');\r\n          }\r\n          for(var i=1;i 1) {\n\t\t\tdocument.write('');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('1 of ' + (arrArticleImageIds.length) + '');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('Full Size');\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("articlePhoto").className = "articlePhoto";\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tdocument.write('');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('1 of 1');\n\t\t\tdocument.write('Full Size');\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("articlePhoto").className = "articlePhoto";\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction nextSlide() {\n\t\tif (intSlideshowPosition  0) {\n\t\t\tintSlideshowPosition--;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tintSlideshowPosition = arrArticleImageIds.length - 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tintSlideshowTracking = true;\n\t\tloadInlineImage(intSlideshowPosition);\n\t}\n\n\tfunction buttonMenu() {\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction buttonPush(e) {\n\t\tif (!e) var e = window.event;\n\t\tif (e.button != 2) {\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(this.id).style.cssText = "margin: 2px 0px 0px 2px;";\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction buttonRelease(e) {\n\t\tif (!e) var e = window.event;\n\t\tif (e.button != 2) {\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById(this.id).style.cssText = "margin: 1px;";\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction initSlideshow() {\n\t\tif (arrArticleImageIds.length > 1) {\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowL").onclick = prevSlide;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowR").onclick= nextSlide;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowL").oncontextmenu = buttonMenu;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowR").oncontextmenu= buttonMenu;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowL").onmousedown = buttonPush;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowR").onmousedown = buttonPush;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowL").onmouseup = buttonRelease;\n\t\t\tdocument.getElementById("slideshowR").onmouseup = buttonRelease;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n     \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n&nbsp;powered by  Sphere\r\n\r\n\t\r\n        \r\n\r\n            \r\n                Featured Broker sponsored link\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n                \n\n\t\r\n\t');\n                if ((!document.images && navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Mozilla/2.") >= 0) || navigator.userAgent.indexOf("WebTV") >= 0) {\n                    document.write('');\n                    document.write('');\n                }\n          }\n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n    \r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n            \r\n                \r\n            \r\n                \r\n            \r\n                \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (i=0; i\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n    \r\n\tEditor's Choice\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n    A selection of our best photos from the past 24 hours.&nbsp; View&nbsp;Slideshow&nbsp;\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n    Top NewsInDepthEntertainment\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n    Lifestyle: Americans know Big Macs better than commandmentsHealth: Old virus causing new disease in U.S.Politics: Bush again calls Castro "cruel dictator"\n  \r\n\r\n\n\n\t\r\n\t');\n                if ((!document.images && navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Mozilla/2.") >= 0) || navigator.userAgent.indexOf("WebTV") >= 0) {\n                    document.write('');\n                    document.write('');\n                }\n          }\n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n    \r\n\r\n\n\n');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (i=0; i\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n    \r\n\tMost Popular on Reuters\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBanks to set up $80 bln fund to limit credit crunch\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFamily beaten as YouTube party descends into chaos\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWITNESS: I told Doris Lessing she won a Nobel prize\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKnights Templar win heresy reprieve after 700 years\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNo sex for 40 mln years?

Or, as Fox calls it:  Breaking news."\n\nOne personality called it "too much information," saying  that Obama was showing a sign of insecurity by not simply saying he was making a fashion statement.\n\n"This is typical press hypocrisy," says Maher.  "They say they want someone who doesn't give pat political answers, but when they get one, they call them a loser.  They say they don't want safe robots like [Sen. Hillary Clinton], but they create conditions where only that species can survive.\n\nAnd then, they give cover to people like Sean Hannity, who reported on No-Pin-gate...and then had to call a doctor because his fake outrage hard-on lasted longer than 72 hours."\n\n"Of course, the Republicans are the party of Mark Foley, and Ted Haggard, and Larry Craig, and countless other closeted homosexuals... so their fixation on jewelry is understandable."\n\nVideo of the entire monologue, and the remaining New Rules segment, is below.  It was broadcast on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on October 12, 2007.\n\n\n\n                        \n                              \n                              \n                              \n\n                              \n                                \n                                  Advertisements\n                                \n                                \n                                  Want a gift card?

of knot and actually sleeps, dammit, for most of the journey? \r\n \r\n\r\nOk, so I am talking about economy class, which also means I am talking about the flights most of us endure.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd queue for.  And pay for, plus all the taxes.  And have to go on if we wish to get practically anywhere else, such as all those places investigated for this slot by all our own correspondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it does not have to be like that.  \r\n\r\nFlying heyday\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week I flew in a Zeppelin.  \r\n\r\nAnd from the spot, Friedrichshafen by Lake Constance in southern Germany, where the very first Zeppelin ascended back in 1900.  \r\n\r\n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t\n            \n            \n                \n\t\t\n                \n                     \n                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhat a flight, with meals in the dining room, cabins to sleep in\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                     \n                    \n\t\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n\t\n\t\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\r\nWe just cruised for 40 minutes, but could open the windows, speak without effort, enjoy watching the world go by 1,000 ft (300m) below, and tell ourselves what it must have been like when far bigger airships were having their heyday. Such as the Graf Zeppelin which went around the world in 1929 in four hops, starting from the US, touching down in Germany, then in Japan, and then in California.  \r\n\r\nWhat a flight, with meals in the dining room, cabins to sleep in, and our beautiful planet not six miles down and invisible but usually a mere 1,500 ft (450m) below.  \r\n\r\nThink of all such trips. \r\n\r\nPerhaps down to Rio in one hop, dancing if you felt like it, walking about, and not just to a doll's-house loo. \r\n\r\nAnd then stopping above your destination, watching the sun come up, shouting at the locals and then disembarking without the used-rag feeling which modern aircraft induce but refreshed, invigorated, well-fed, well-slept and delighted to be alive, instead of merely grateful that the long-haul, as they call it, has finally been concluded.\r\n\r\nSafer travel\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one thing everyone knows about airships is that the Hindenburg spectacularly caught fire in May 1937 when landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey after a flight from Germany.  \r\n\r\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Hindenburg crashed along with the airship industry in 1937\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is less well known is that two-thirds of those on board, 62 out of the 97 passengers and crew, survived the disaster. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course hydrogen catches fire - just as petrol or aviation spirit do given the incentive of an accident, but no airship uses hydrogen these days, however much airlines use their combustible fuel.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHelium is now used as buoyancy for airships, this is sometimes called non-flammable helium as if there is another kind.  There is not. \r\n\r\nAnd this light gas is more inert than water. It certainly cannot catch fire.\r\n\r\nLeisurely pace\r\n\r\n\r\nSo let us dream a bit.  \r\n\r\nImagine taking off in an airship from Heathrow, ascending far more quietly and steeply than everything else, before setting off for, say, Rome at the entrancing height of 1,500ft .  \r\n\r\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImagine a leisurely airship journey with time to enjoy the city sights\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\r\nWatch Kent and its orchards go by, then Dover's white cliffs, and the busy English Channel. \r\n\r\n \r\nCruise over French chateaux, admire their vineyards, and then repair - as they say - to the dining area.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMeet France's contours towards the south, and then drop down to the famous Cote d'Azur, have a look at all those Anglais on their promenade, perhaps speaking with them through an open window after halting in mid-air with the engines no more than idling.\r\n\r\nThen out, lower still, over the Mediterranean - say at 500ft above the waves - until it is time for supper, for a final drink at the bar, and then to bed.  \r\n\r\n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t\n            \n            \n                \n\t\t\n                \n                     \n                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tThat single accident 70 years ago should not blind us to the fact that airship flying is total joy from beginning to end and in between\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n\t\n\t\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWake up east of Corsica and cruise down Italy's coast, past Elba, past Orbetello and Civitavecchia while you breakfast before touching down at Rome, not with a solid thump plus a flurry of brakes and reverse thrust, but gently and perhaps even unnoticeably as a ground-crew catch hold of the landing lines.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it has taken 24 hours from London rather than two or three, but the holiday and joy and wonder began at Heathrow instead of when your aircraft's wheels yelp on meeting ground again.\r\n\r\nGlory days\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my German flight there were 14 on board, one pilot, one stewardess, and 12 punters.  \r\n\r\nYes, it cost 250 euros (�174) per person, and London to Rome would be rather more, but what joy would be possible, perhaps only once in a lifetime.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe trip would certainly remind us that flight does not have to be foul, cramped, undignified and an easy way to get a DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis).  \r\n\r\nIt could actually be glorious just as it was in the old days when, starting in 1910, airship passenger flights were frequent - and without mishap - until 27 years later when the Hindenburg caught fire.\r\n\r\nThat single accident 70 years ago should not blind us to the fact that airship flying is total joy from beginning to end and in between.  \r\n\r\nLike every other economy sardine, I long for the alternative of actually enjoying a flight.\r\n\r\nFrom Our Own Correspondent was broadcast on Saturday 13 October, 2007 at 1130 BST on BBC Radio 4.

Mostly negative ones.\nHere's the big reason I feel as uneasy as I do: it's tantamount to an admission of defeat.&nbsp; The only way Linux can "succeed" is if it looks like Windows.&nbsp; And frankly, isn't there something hypocritical about railing against Microsoft for not innovating and then turning around and mimicking them, right down to the chrome on the user interface?\nThis comes back to a question many people have asked before.&nbsp; Does Linux have to look like Windows to work?&nbsp; Not "beat Windows at its own game", which if you ask me is a red herring, but work.&nbsp; Granted, the Windows UI is familiar territory for most people with at least some degree of computer use, but that doesn't mean it has to be the be-all and end-all of UI design.\nI think part of the problem is that starting from absolute scratch with a UI is a terribly daunting project -- why reinvent the wheel when there's plenty of them already around? -- and I can see why that would cause someone to simply reach for what's handy and available instead of trying to break the mold.\nIt's a temptation that need to be fought.&nbsp; Even if it's just incrementally and over time, Linux needs to step completely away from Windows as a paradigm for success and see what it can accomplish on its own.\nMy feeling is that if Linux users create something that is useful and attractive on its own merits -- and that doesn't slavishly owe Microsoft a debt -- it will succeed.&nbsp; I'd rather see more time and effort invested in making Linux the best thing it can possibly be on its own terms, not something that feels obliged to play catch-up at every turn.&nbsp; I want to see more diversity between OSes, not less.\n\n&laquo; Web's Future Could Be Determined By The Fight Between Google And Nokia |\nMain\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\n\n\n \n\n\nThis is a public forum.
