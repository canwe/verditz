      can and will work at a desk for seven hours straight, routinely.</font></b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">
For several years, I have been teaching 18.30, differential equation,
the largest mathematics course at MIT, with more than 300 students. The
lectures have been good training in dealing with mass behavior. Every
sentence must be perfectly enunciated, preferably twice. Examples on
the board must be relevant, if not downright fascinating. Every 15
minutes or so, the lecturer is expected to come up with an interesting
aside, joke, historical anecdote, or unusual application of the concept
at hand. When a lecturer fails to conform to these inexorable
requirements, the students will signify their displeasure by picking by
their books and leaving the classroom.</font></p><p></p></td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the lecturer's best efforts, however, it becomes
more difficult to hold the attention of the students as the term wears
on, and they start falling asleep in class under those circumstances
should be a source of satisfaction for a teacher, since it confirms
that they have been doing their jobs. There students have been up half
the night-maybe all night-finishing problem sets and preparing for
their midterm exams.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
	  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Four courses in science and engineering each term is a heavy workload for 
      anyone; very few students fail to learn, first and foremost, the discipline of intensive and constant work.</font></p> 
<p align="justify"> 
	  <font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Two: </font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">You learn what you don't know you are learning.</font></b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">The
second lesson is demonstrated, among other places, in 18.313, a course
I teach in advanced probability theory. It is a difficult course, one
that compresses the material typically taught in a year into one term,
and it includes weekly problem sets that are hard, even by the
standards of professional mathematicians. (How hard is that? Well,
every few years a student taking the course discovers a new solution to
a probability problem that merits publication as a research paper in a
refereed journal.)</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Students
join forces on the problem sets, and some students benefit more than
others from these weekly collective efforts. The most brilliant
students will invariably work out all the problems and let other
students copy, and I pretend to be annoyed when I learn that this has
happened. But I know that by making the effort to understand the
solution of a truly difficult problem discovered by one of their peers,
students learn more than they would by working out some less demanding
exercise.</font></p> 
 
<p align="justify"> 
	  <font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Three: </font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By and large, "knowing how" matters more than "knowing what."</font></b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">Half
a century ago, the philosopher Gilbert Ryle discussed the difference
between "knowing how" courses are those in mathematics, the exact
sciences, engineering, playing a musical instrument, even sports.
"Knowing what" courses are those in the social sciences, the creative
arts, the humanities, and those aspects of a discipline that are
described as having social value.</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></p><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each term, students meet with their
advisors to decide on the courses each will study, and much of the
discussion is likely to resolve around whether a student should lighten
a heavy load by substituting one or two "knowing what" courses in place
of some stiff "knowing how" courses.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
	  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, the content of "knowing what" courses if often
the most memorable. A serious study of the history of United States
Constitution or </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2"> King Lear</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2"><i> 
      </i>may
well leave a stronger imprint on a student's character than a course in
thermodynamics. Nevertheless, at MIT, "knowing how" is held in higher
esteem than "knowing what" by faculty and students alike. Why?</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;It
is my theory that "knowing how" is revered because it can be tested.
One can test whether a student can apply quantum mechanics, communicate
in French, or clone a gene. It is much more difficult to asses an
interpretation of a poem, the negotiation of a complex technical
compromise, or grasp of the social dynamics of a small, diverse working
group. Where you can test, you can set a high standard of proficiency
on which everyone is agreed; where you cannot test precisely,
proficiency becomes something of a judgment call.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;At
certain liberal arts colleges, sports appear to be more important than
classroom subjects, and with good reason. A sport may be the only
training in "knowing how"-in demonstrating certifiable proficiency-that
a student undertakes at those colleges. At MIT, sports are a hobby
(however passionately pursued) rather than a central focus because we
offer a wide range of absorbing "knowing how" activities.</font></p> 
	   
	  <p align="justify"> 
	  <font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Four: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>In science and engineering, you can fool very little of the time.</b></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">Most
of the sweeping generalizations one hears about MIT undergraduates are
too outrageous to be taken seriously. The claim that MIT students are
naive, however, has struck me as being true, at least in a statistical
sense.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Last
year, for example, one of our mathematics majors, who had accepted a
lucrative offer of employment from a Wall Street firm, telephoned to
complain that the politics in his office was "like a soap opera." More
than a few MIT graduates are shocked by their first contact with the
professional world after graduation. There is a wide gap between the
realities of business, medicine, law, or applied&nbsp;&nbsp;
enginering, for example, and the universe of scientific objectivity and
theoretical constructs that is MIT.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;An
education in engineering and science is an education in intellectual
honesty. Students cannot avoid learning to acknowledge whether or not
they have really learned. Once they have taken their first quiz, all
MIT undergraduates know dearly they will pay if they fool themselves
into believing they know more than is the case.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;On
campus, they have been accustomed to people being blunt to a fault
about their own limitations-or skills-and those of others.
Unfortunately, this intellectual honesty is sometimes interpreted as
naivete.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">	 
	  </font><p align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Five:</font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You don't have to be a genius to do creative work.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">The
idea of genius elaborated during the Romantic Age (late 18th and 19th
centuries) has done harm to education. It is demoralizing to give a
young person role models of Beethoven, Einstein, and Feynman, presented
as saintly figures who moved from insight to insight without a misstep.
Scientific biographies often fail to give a realistic description of
personality, and thereby create a false idea of scientific work.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people will correct any fantasies they have about
genius, however, after they come to MIT. As they start doing research
with their professors, as many MIT undergraduates do, they learn
another healthy lesson, namely, a professor may well behave like a
fumbling idiot.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive for excellence and achievement that one finds
everywhere at MIT has the democratic effect of placing teachers and
students on the same level, where competence is appreciated
irrespective of its provenance, Students learn that some of the best
ideas arise in groups of scientists and engineers working together, and
the source of these ideas can seldom be pinned on specific individuals.
The MIT model of scientific work is closer to the communion of artists
that was found in the large shops of the Renaissance than to the image
of the lonely Romantic genius.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Six:</font></font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You must measure up to a very high level of performance.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">I
can imagine a propective student or parent asking, "Why should I (or my
child) take calculus at MIT rather than at Oshkosh College? Isn't the
material practically identical, no matter where it is taught, while the
cost varies a great deal?"</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;One answer to this question would be following: One learns
a lot more when taking calculus from someone who is doing research in
mathematical analysis than from someone who has never published a word
on the subject. But this is not the answer; some teachers who is doing
research in mathematical analysis than from someone who has never
published a word on the subject. But this is not the answer; some
teachers who have never done any research are much better at conveying
the ideas of calculus than the most brilliant mathematicians.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;What matters most is the ambiance in which the course is
taught; a gifted student will thrive in the company of other gifted
students. An MIT undergraduate will be challenged by the level of
proficiency that is expected of everyone at MIT, students and faculty.
The expectation of high standards is unconsciously absorbed and adopted
by the students, and they carry it with them for life.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson seven:</font></font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The world and your career are unpredictable, so you are better off learning subjects of permanent value.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">
Some students arrive at MIT with a career plan, many don't, but it
actually doesn't matter very much either way. Some of the foremost
computer scientists of our day received their doctorates in
mathematical logic, a branch of mathematics that was once considered
farthest removed from applications but that turned out instead to be
the key to the development of present-day software. A number of the
leading figures in experimental molecular biology received their
doctorates in physics. Dramatic career shifts that only a few years ago
were the exception are becoming common.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students will have a harder time finding rewarding jobs
than I had when I graduated in the fifties. The skills the market
demands, both in research and industry, are subject to capricious
shifts. New professions will be created, and old professions will
become obsolete with the span of a few years. Today's college students
have good cause to be apprehensive about future.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">  
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum that most undergraduates at MIT choose to
follow focuses less on current occupational skills than on those
fundamental areas of science and engineering that at least likely to be
affected by technological changes.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Eight:</font></font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You are never going to catch up, and neither is anyone else.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">MIT
students often complain of being overworked, and they are right. When I
look at the schedules of courses my advisees propose at the beginning
of each term, I wonder how they can contemplate that much work. My
workload was nothing like that when I was an undergraduate.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;The platitudes about the disappearance of leisure are,
unfortunately, true, and faculty members at MIT are as heavily burdened
as students. There is some satisfaction, however, for a faculty member
in encountering a recent graduate who marvels at the light work load
they carry in medical school or law school relative to the grueling
schedule they had to maintain during their four years at MIT.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Nine:</font></font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The future belongs to the computer-literate-squared.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">Much
has been said about computer literacy, and I suspect you would prefer
not to hear more on the subject. Instead, I would like to propose the
concept computer-literacy-squared, in other words computer literacy to
second degree.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;A large fraction of MIT undergraduates major in computer
science or at least acquire extensive computer skills that are
applicable in other fields. In their second year, they catch on to the
fact that their required courses in computer science do not provide the
whole story. Not because of deficiencies in the syllabus; quite the
opposite. The undergraduate curriculum in computer science at MIT is
probably the most progressive and advanced such curriculum anywhere.
Rather, the students learn that side by side with required courses
there is another, hidden curriculum consisting of new ideas just coming
into use, new techniques and that spread like wildfire, opening up
unsuspected applications that will eventually be adopted into the
official curriculum.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping up with this hidden curriculum is what will enable
a computer scientist to stay ahead in the field. Those who do not
become computer scientists to the second degree risk turning into
programmers who will only implement the ideas of others.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
 
</font></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
<font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3">Lesson Ten:</font></font></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#a60250" size="3"> 
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Mathematics is still the queen of the sciences.</b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">Having
tried in lessons one through nine to take an unbiased look at the big
MIT picture, I'd like to conclude with a plug for my own field,
mathematics.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
 
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;When an undergraduate asks me whether
he or she should major in mathematics rather than in another field that
I will simply call X, my answer is the following: "If you major in
mathematics, you can switch to X anytime you want to, but not the other
way around." </p> 
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Alumni who return to visit invariably
complain of not having taken enough math courses while they were
undergraduates. It is a fact, confirmed by the history of science since
Galileo and Newton, that the more theoretical and removed from
immediate applications a scientific topic appears to be, the more
likely it is to eventually find the most striking practical
applications. Consider number theory, which only 20 years ago was
believed to be the most useless chapter of mathematics and is today the
core of computer security. The efficient factorization of integers into
prime numbers, a topic of seemingly breathtaking obscurity, is now
cultivated with equal passion by software desigers and code breakers.</p> 
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am often asked why there are so few
applied mathematicians in the department at MIT. The reason is that all
of MIT is one huge applied mathematics department; you can find applied
mathematicians in practicially every department at MIT <i>except</i> mathematics.</p>
