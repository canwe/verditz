		<h2>An Open Letter to ISO</h2>
		<span class="post-date" title="Date">September 7, 2007</span>
		<span class="post-time" title="Time">10:03 am</span>
		<span class="post-author" title="Author">isene</span>
		<span class="post-cath" title="Category"><a href="http://blogs.freecode.no/isene/category/iso-oasis-w3c-ietf-etc/" title="View all posts in Standardization" rel="category tag">Standardization</a></span>
		<span class="post-edit"></span>
		<p><strong>Is it time to standardize <a href="http://www.iso.org" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a>?</strong></p>
<p>In light of the recent events relating to the standardization process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooxml" title="ECMA Office Open XML">EOOXML</a>, it seems appropriate to look into possible standardization of the process itself.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1070" title="Draft International Standard 29500">DIS 29500</a> (EOOXML) process has revealed several shortcomings, both on the national level and on the level of ISO.</p>
<p>The organisations representing each country have very different procedures for determining the nation&#8217;s vote in ISO. Some countries will vote only if their technical committee is unanimous on the issue. Others will reach consensus defined by a 3/4 majority vote or even 2/3 majority. In some countries there is no vote and the technical committee is only advisory to the national standards organisation. Others yet have a two-stage process where the nations vote is determined through two committees. In short there is no standard for accepting a standard.</p>
<p>It seems ISO is not prepared for a politicized process where a big and influential commercial enterprise will use any means possible to push its own standard through to certification.</p>
<p>Committees are flooded by the vendor in support of the <a href="http://www.grokdoc.net/index.php/EOOXML_objections" title="A standard in need of improvement">standard</a>. Votes are bought and results are hijacked. Several national bodies have flawed and skewed procedures open for corruption.</p>
<p>The list is much longer, but a few examples should suffice:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.freecode.no/isene/2007/08/24/3/" title="A process in Norway">Norway</a> - originally a process decided by unanimity but altered on the fly<br />
<a href="http://ffii.se/pr/2007-08-27-se-ooxml-vote-en.html" title="Voting in Sweden">Sweden</a> - voting seats bought and the result thus hijacked<br />
<a href="http://www.noooxml.org/forum/t-15521/swiss-cheese" title="Voting in Switzerland">Switzerland</a> - process rigged in favor of the vendor, the chairman excluded the option of voting &#8220;reject&#8221; or &#8220;reject, with comments&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://wiki.ansol.org/CT-173-LDD-Meeting-002" title="Summary of the meeting in Portugal">Portugal</a> - process skewed by blaming on lack of available chairs<br />
<a href="http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2007/09/ooxml-is-not-ye.html" title="The mystery in Malaysia">Malaysia</a> - two committees voted unanimously &#8220;rejection with comments&#8221; and mysteriously overturned by the government to &#8220;abstain&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if this is the tip of an ice berg, the examples should warrant a thorough examination of the national processes.</p>
<p>The fact that ISO enforces no standard for national bodies opens the standardization process for manipulation or corruption. I strongly urge ISO to adopt a strict policy for its members detailing the rules for how a national body shall determine its vote in ISO and that it enforces such policy vigorously.</p>
<p>On the level of ISO, criticism has been raised against the fast track process. An investigation should be called to see if EOOXML was unduly put on the ISO Fast Track.</p>
<p>During the Fast Track, many new countries have joined as P-Members (Participating members) in the technical committee, the JTC1. Several of the countries have no credible track on standardization work, have joined very late in the process only to vote an unconditional &#8220;Yes&#8221; to a standard that has obvious room for improvement. It may be purely coincidental that the countries that came late in the process score much lower on the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International. It is possible to corrupt the process by pressuring countries to join a process and vote without sufficient knowledge. I urge ISO to adopt a policy that P-members may not be accepted later than 3 months before the committee is to vote.</p>
<p>It may be time also to reevaluate the one country one vote principle. In ISO, the Chinese vote carries the same weight as that of Cyprus. In the JTC1/SC34 the late-comers includes Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, CÃ´te-d&#8217;Ivoire, Cyprus, Lebanon and Malta.</p>
<p>As for approving standards within the field of IT, ISO would greatly benefit from adopting the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/" title="The Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</a> requirment of two independent reference implementations for passing a standard. This should increase the quality of ISO&#8217;s IT standards.</p>
<p>The strength, integrity and scalability of ISO have been tested. The organizations agility and adaptability will now be measured. May ISO move quickly to fix its own PR and more importantly its own standardization process.</p>
<p>The publicity that ISO has been given through the DIS 29500 process is phenomenal. ISO and standardization in general has reached a peak in public awareness. I hope the organization will use this publicity to show strong integrity and potential.</p>
<p>The intent of this letter is to safeguard future standardization and to ensure that the processes scale in the face of increased pressure from large commercial interests.</p>

   <p>Geir,</p>
<p>I second everything you wrote. Couldn&#8217;t have said it better.</p>
<p>It is time to call ISO&#8217;s integrity. If there will be business as usual in<br />
following-up the comments received during ballot I strongly question the<br />
legitimity of this important organization.</p>

   <p>thanx for your thoughts! someone had to do it. its incredible that a standards body like ISO can be so blatantly corrupt, and despite all pointers towards corruption, mischief, microsoft seems to be getting away lightly. its disgusting to note that there aren&#8217;t many voice who condemn microsoft&#8217;s behavior. i looks like a case of big money flowing all over the world. microsoft knows whats at stake, and a loss of the format war will cost them their stable cash cow, the office, which they force it down everyone&#8217;s throat. its time to over throw them and their corrupt party.</p>

   <p>IEEE is just as corrupt. Their HLA standard for simulation was approved before it was ever tried in practice. The US Deputy Secretary of Defense then mandated it. Later it was discovered it didn&#8217;t work, but by then too many careers had been staked on it. The US DoD now has a dog of a simulation standard. If IEEE had done their job, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened. Standard bodies that can be bought are useless.</p>

   <p>Nice letter. Thanks!</p>
<p>Are you sending this letter officially to ISO? If not, will it come to the attention of the decision makers in ISO?</p>
<p>Definitely, the ISO process needs changes to provide such manipulations. If the reforms can be carried out before the next round of manipulations in the upcoming BRM, ISO&#8217;s reputation will be not be sullied.</p>

   <p>I disagree on only one point </p>
<p>&#8220;It may be time also to reevaluate the one country one vote principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>It makes sense to give large countries/entities a larger vote when it comes to the details of a standard, but the basic need/desire to implement a standard is a boolean decision.  Just because China is huge doesn&#8217;t mean it should be able to veto a standard into ISO that is useless to the majority of the worlds&#8217; other member countries.</p>
<p>Aside from that, great letter.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re absolutely right.  This sort of corruption and gaming of the system should never have been allowed to happen. And with the widespread publicity this incident has generated, I suspect the credibility of both the ISO and Microsoft has been badly damaged.</p>
<p>I fully agree with your proposals for dealing with this, and I hope I never see such a thing happen again.</p>

   <p>I have my doubts about &#8220;a policy that P-members may not be accepted later than 3 months before the committee is to vote&#8221;</p>
<p>If this were to happen in future, it could work to the advantage of the company intending to push through its own standard, since they&#8217;d be the only ones to know when their proposal is going to be submitted. While nobody is looking, it stuffs as many NBs as possible with its supporters, then submits its proposal for the fast-track procedure, and when people notice what&#8217;s happening it will be too late for them to participate.</p>

   <p>Committees and organisations are not corrupt, but people can be.  This is what has been used time and time again - influencing decision makers who don&#8217;t stand firmly in their shoes or, worse, don&#8217;t care about the side effects in business and in law.  It just leaves me wondering: if that tactic doesn&#8217;t work any more, what&#8217;s next?  Straight out mob tactics and kidnapping? Ve have ze nuke and ve are nod afraid to uuse iet?  It all feels exceptionally desperate to me (or arrogance in extremis, take your pick).</p>
<p>For the amount of talent that company has bought this is simply pathetic.  I&#8217;d make it a &#8220;do not buy&#8221; in share terms because this is bound to go wrong, and that moment seems to be getting nearer if I read this behaviour right.</p>

   <p>Geir,</p>
<p>A very well articulated letter, thanks. </p>
<p>I have been following and blogging about M$&#8217;s scandalous treatment of the ISO with this process. It is almost beyond belief that a company can seemingly get away with what they have&#8230;</p>
<p>One thing I would urge all readers to do is to lobby your local MP. In the UK there is increasing awareness of Open Source, and our MPs are generally happy to listen to individuals&#8217; concerns. </p>
<p>Only by increasing the VOLUME on this subject, will there be any pressure for change.</p>

   <p>It would seem that the standards-process could simply prevent new members from voting on any standards already on the table.  That would prevent ballot-stuffing by adding countries that are only interested in the one issue already on the table.  It should also help limit involvement to those countries that are truely interested in creating <em>real</em> standards through <em>open</em> processes.</p>

   <p>Very nice letter. Thanks for putting this together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to propose that there be some penalty or disqualification process for ISO units that are &#8220;bought off&#8221; so as to discourage countries from allowing corrupt ISO voters into their organizations.</p>
<p><strong>We cannot have our standards process be corrupted by greed!</strong></p>

   <p>ISO reputation as a approver of World standard has been tarnished. Not so much for the way they do business but for showing the World they can be manipulated by big money. Microsoft probably spend millions of dollars to buy votes and to influence the voting procedure by corrupting the system. Fortunately, for all concerned, Microsoft&#8217;s efforts failed. Will this type is immoral, underhanded cheating of the &#8220;system&#8221; happen again? Most likely. Microsoft has learned from the experience and will in all probability, try it again. ISO, please - wake up. Fix your voting system. Show the World that you are a true leader in approving standards.</p>

   <p>Instead of a passive time-based test for being a P-member: &#8220;member for &gt;3 months&#8221; or &#8220;member before standard proposed&#8221;, I would prefer something effort-based: &#8220;particpated in 3 meetings/teleconferences&#8221;, &#8220;prepared a evaluation of some section of the draft&#8221;, &#8220;has experience implementing the draft&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>This would reduce the change of members just turning up to vote on someting they have no real interest in or knowlege about.</p>

   <p>I think a point you have missed is that a number of these new voters had no participation, that I am aware of in the standards discussion. They just came along and voted as they were told.<br />
I think it should be necessary for the voting bodies to have participated in the process so they at least have opportunity to understand what they are voting about. Standards are after all supposed to be about technical quality and compatibility with existing standards, something that OOXML is obviously not!</p>

   <p>Great letter.  Thanks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about your proposal that new P members not be allowed to vote if they changed their status to P less than 90 days before the vote.  I don&#8217;t think the idea of not allowing new members to participate in new standards that are already under discussion.  I&#8217;m not sure what the answer is, but I&#8217;m intrigued by David Bowen&#8217;s proposal that they be required to have participated.</p>

   <p>When performing an overhaul of a process to make it resistant to corruption, one should think of how the new process could be corrupted as well.  Once the &#8216;corruption resistant&#8217; process is in place, it can be much more difficult to fix it.</p>
<p>I have two changes to propose to bolster the current process; each proposed change is more complicated than I&#8217;d like in an attempt to make it more corruption-resistant.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;d limit the various countries&#8217; ISO processes to no more than their technical committee voted.  That is, if the technical committee votes &#8216;Yes, with comments&#8217;, the country cannot vote &#8216;Yes&#8217;, no comment.  If the technical committee votes &#8216;No, with comments&#8217;, the country cannot vote &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;Yes, with comments&#8217;.  Note that this would put a requirement on countries to *have* a technical committee.  Any discrepancies found should result in the vote being converted to what the technical committee voted, and the offending country&#8217;s ISO process fined.  If the country does not pay the fine within a month, they cannot participate in future votes until they pay.  The fine should probably be limited to no more than double the ISO membership dues.</p>
<p>Second, I personally believe that any restriction on who can vote on any proposal, and whether they vote as a regular member or &#8216;P&#8217; member, must itself be augmented with an anti-corruption measure, or you&#8217;ll actually make things worse instead of better.  My proposal would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>For your vote to count as a regular member, you need to have participated in three prior meetings, or (representing a team that has produced a working implementation of the proposed standard and a member of that team).  The requirements to have your vote count as a &#8216;P&#8217; member should be higher.  You still vote; if your vote would change the outcome if it had the weight you wanted, the vote is deferred until a later meeting, when you&#8217;ve had an opportunity to meet the requirements for your vote to count.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would suggest that the process only allow one additional opportunity to meet the requirements - if you&#8217;re two meetings short, you&#8217;d be the swing vote, and you&#8217;re not at the next meeting, there can be another vote at the next meeting.  If there isn&#8217;t a vote then, and you do make the meeting after that, if you still don&#8217;t meet the criteria via a non-meeting-count manner, the vote won&#8217;t be deferred again for you.  It may be deferred for someone else, however.</p>

   <p>lets be clear here:</p>
<p>I think the ISO body knows the problems for a long time, now just more apparent and in light of more media attention</p>
<p>it should act now if it does not want to carry over the legacy shadow of companies that buy-in to ISO</p>

   <p>The solution seems obvious to me: weigh a nation&#8217;s vote based only on the length of time it has participated in the ISO process.  The factor should be something like log2(number of months).</p>

   <p>It&#8217;s necessary to think about substitute the norms of the german DIN clube by Open Norms.</p>
<p>The manner of decision by DIN (what is a privat clube, principally supported by the industry) shocked many observers. In its decision process, was openly said to do some abreviations of the process exactly to avoid contrary means.</p>
<p>And its decision is contrary to the population&#8217;s opinion, as in Germany open software inclusive Linux are used by plenty people &#8230;</p>

   <p>Brasil&#8217;s NB defined consensus as &#8220;no justified objection&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many stoppers and non-stoppers comments arrised with justification during the discussion period. Microsoft, asside from voting &#8220;Yes&#8221;, could not produce technical justification to drop the stoppers comments. The only logical conclusion was the &#8220;No&#8221; position, that Microsoft loudly objected but could not address propper. So the final result was consensus being &#8220;No&#8221;.</p>
<p>Could Microsoft justify with technical merits these comments as being non-stoppers, would the result been other.</p>
