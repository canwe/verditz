<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/09/18.html">Joel Spolsky</a>: <em>What&#8217;s going to happen? The winners are going to do what worked at Bell Labs in 1978: build a programming language, like C, that&#8217;s portable and efficient. It should compile down to &#8220;native&#8221; code (native code being JavaScript and DOMs) with different backends for different target platforms, where the compiler writers obsess about performance so you don&#8217;t have to. It&#8217;ll have all the same performance as native JavaScript with full access to the DOM in a consistent fashion, and it&#8217;ll compile down to IE native and Firefox native portably and automatically. And, yes, it&#8217;ll go into your CSS and muck around with it in some frightening but provably-correct way so you never have to think about CSS incompatibilities ever again. Ever. Oh joyous day that will be.</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder why Joel and others didn't make greater use of <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/">Dean Edward&#8217;s IE7</a> at the time.&#160; Possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joel and others hadn&#8217;t heard of Dean&#8217;s efforts at the time, for whatever reason.</li>
<li>Browser incompatibility wasn&#8217;t so much of an issue in 2004-2005.&#160; One way to look at this is that IE&#8217;s dominance at the time was substantial enough that developers could get away with requiring IE and the situation has changed enough that this merits revisiting.</li>
<li>Dean&#8217;s efforts were in the wrong direction... people prefer the APIs as Microsoft implements them.</li>
<li>Dean&#8217;s efforts were incomplete, or performed poorly, or was otherwise inadequate.</li>
<li>Dean&#8217;s IE7 was an all or nothing proposition.&#160; It would modify the behavior of existing apps, which was unacceptable.</li>
<li>Applications worked nearly enough without the download that enough people wouldn&#8217;t make the effort, and the net result would be one additional platform to support.</li>
<li>Dean&#8217;s efforts, while interesting, didn&#8217;t have enough corporate backing to justify a company to depend on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft, Mozilla, and others work to eliminate their differences.&#160; Joel discounts this possibility, and given the progress at <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter">W3C</a>, it is hard to argue with Joel&#8217;s assessment.&#160; Microsoft has to walk a fine line between throwing its weight around and not showing up, and at the moment they seem to be consistently erring towards the latter.&#160; Having a solid beta / tech preview would address this, but there is no indication that this is likely any time soon.</li>
<li>Something like <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> comes along (coupled with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a>).&#160; Such a solution doesn&#8217;t fix your CSS, it replaces many of the technologies that you are used to with new ones.&#160; There are no indications that such a solution will ever be deployed on an iPhone.&#160; Some have expressed concerns that once Silverlight gains enough tractions, the cooperation that Novell is currently seeing will dry up.</li>
<li>Something like <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2007/07/new_projects.html">ScreamingMonkey</a> comes along and solves the JavaScript incompatibilities.&#160; I see no indication that this plans to address DOM incompatibilities or CSS incompatibilities, either of which alone can be worse than JavaScript incompatibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I can&#8217;t see anything in any of these solutions that is clearly better than reviving Dean&#8217;s efforts, but I would be interested in hearing Joel&#8217;s take on this.</p>

When I read this last night, I was wondering if Joel had ever heard of <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo</a>.

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
I wonder if Joel is hedging Fog Creek as a potential <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html">winner</a>? The thing I don&#8217;t get is, doesn&#8217;t Joel realize <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google has already done what he described</a>?

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
Yeah I agree with you Justin, GWT is also a solution.&#160; I guess maybe Joel is saying we don&#8217;t know who will be the dominant framework yet (consider all the others like Dojo, Prototype, YUI, etc), but that&#8217;s kind of obvious.

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
<p>&#8220;where the compiler writers obsess about performance so you don&#8217;t have to&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?&#160; Pre- and post- operators, weird pointer stuff out the wazzoo, macros.&#160; C was a portable assembly language.&#160; Heck, writing a compiler for it was almost like writing a super-high-end macro assembler.&#160; Of course you had to obsess over performance to use C.&#160; And the compiler writers barely had to obsess at all because C surfaced all the funky stuff the machines of the day had in their assembly languages.</p>
<p>I do see things like Silverlight and Flex redefining semantics within their own world.&#160; The Flex guys already tout that they deal with browser incompatibilities.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>BW</p>

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>Something like Silverlight comes along (coupled with Moonlight).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hardly.</p>
<p>Any non-free software developed without standards-track specification (Silverlight, Moonlight, Flash etc) will never be the future of the web. Not my web, anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine any serious web technologists suggesting these applications as an answer. If they are doing, I&#8217;m not sure I want to know the question.</p>

<h3>Flex/Flash Solve A Lot of Problems:  They May Be Disintermediating the Browser</h3>
Joel Spolsky gave out a big yada yada post over at his blog that wound up saying the browser incompatibility has got to stop.&#160; He draws parallels with how portability won the day in programming languages.&#160; A lot of what he says is right, some of it...

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m partnering up with <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/09/19/Joels-Strategy#c1190250698">Noah</a>. Neither of the mentioned solutions are good enough. No, not even <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> or <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo</a>. They are all either too proprietary, too closed or too inaccessible to be able to replace all the goodness that comes out of simple HTML+CSS+JavaScript based applications.</p>
<p>Both OpenLaszlo and GWT serializes to JavaScript mayhem, completely inaccessible by Google&#8217;s own search engine and anyone else who has a problem comprehending anything but simple HTML. The other ones require plugins and are very un-webby. That&#8217;s so un-cool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that Joel&#8217;s dream web framework will never exist, I&#8217;m just saying it doesn&#8217;t today and none of the contenders are even remotely close to being it.</p>

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
<p>When I read Joel&#8217;s piece, I can&#8217;t help but be left thinking his whole premise is wrong.&#160; Joel says,<br />
<blockquote class="quote"><p>The NewSDK will be the second coming of Microsoft Windows; this is exactly how Lotus lost control of the spreadsheet market.
</p></blockquote></p>
<p>To me, this seems to imply that &#8220;he who creates NewSDK will 'own the web'&#8221;, which is patently absurd.</p>
<p>Can software development and distribution from 1990 really be compared to today?&#160; Hasn&#8217;t the entire dynamic of competition and software choice changed?</p>
<p>I think we need to worry more about data silos and software patents then we do about some new framework or API getting a monopoly in the web-application space.</p>

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
<p>Why would Silverlight be any more feasible than Firefox with the WHATWG specifications implemented?&#160; (Silverlight, I&#8217;m sure, is more convenient than the fairly modest WHATWG specifications, but that cuts both ways.)</p>
<p>Silverlight isn&#8217;t more widely deployed than Firefox.&#160; I find it quite unlikely it will become more widely deployed.&#160; And the WHATWG specifications may be ignored by MS for a while (maybe a long while), but that might not even be a big deal; people can replicate the functionality in IE without MS&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>When placing bets, I&#8217;ll bet on the web every time.&#160; Most of the people working on the web don&#8217;t even know what we&#8217;re talking about here, and probably don&#8217;t care.&#160; The inertia is incredible, which strongly favors incremental improvements.</p>

<h3>Joel&#8217;s Strategy</h3>
I started to read Joel&#8217;s piece yesterday.&#160; At first I was reading, but then he started talking about &#8220;NewSDK&#8221; as if SDKs actually mattered in the grand scheme of things.&#160; So then I switched to skimming, and the further along I got, the more hand-waving he did, and the less sense he made.&#160; So I stopped reading and went back to trying to be productive.
